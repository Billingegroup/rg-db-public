  abstract: Modern materials under study for next generation technologies, such as
    for energy conversion and storage, environmental remediation and health, are highly
    complex, often heterogeneous and nano-structured.  A full understanding of the
    structure requires us to go beyond crystallography and to study the local aperiodic
    components of the structure, which is a major experimental challenge. Among these
    tools are total scattering at atomic pair distribution function (PDF) methods
    which use diffuse and Bragg scattering to give information about short and intermediate
    range structure in nanomaterials and bulk materials. These methods involve a significant
    amount of signal averaging and information loss due to limited structural coherence
    and non-ideal samples.  Nonetheless, they are critical for understanding nanomaterials
    and are growing in popularity. I will introduce these methods and discuss some
    of the uncertainties associated with modeling and uncertainty estimation and quantification.

  abstract: 'Increasingly we seek smarter ways to deliver therapies in a targeted
    way.  Nanoscience can play an important role in this endeavor and many researchers
    are exploring ways to engineer materials at the nanoscale to get formulations
    for such targeted deliveries. But to do this safely and effectively it is crucial
    to be able to characterize the materials at the atomic scale.  This is difficult
    because of the nanostructure problem, our inability to determine with accuracy
    the arrangements of atoms when those arrangements extend only on nanometer length-scales.  Coming
    from the physics community, the atomic pair distribution function analysis of
    x-ray and neutron powder diffraction is having huge impacts in studies of nanomaterials.  In
    recent developments we were able to extend this to weakly scattering systems,
    dilute systems and molecular systems, making this an ideal tool for studying organics
    and formulations.  The latest x-ray sources and the latest computational methods
    for data analysis and modeling are giving us an unprecedented view into atomic
    arrangements at the nanoscale in organics, pharmaceuticals and excipients.  The
    ability to measure with spatial and temporal resolution is allowing us to visualize
    heterogeneous materials and probe nanostructure inside solid objects.  This talk
    will be a tour of the nanostructure characterization landscape state of the art.  '

  abstract: "In the solid state, small molecules such as active pharmaceutical ingredient\
    \ (API) molecules tend to pack in well defined arrangements leading to different\
    \ crystalline polymorphs. An alternative solid form, increasingly of interest\
    \ in the pharmaceutical industry, is the amorphous state. This state is characterized\
    \ by a broad and largely featureless XRD pattern, the so-called  'amorphous halo',\
    \ devoid of Bragg-peaks due to the lack of long-range order in the packing. There\
    \ is a further, intermediate situation, which that of ultra-small nanoparticulate\
    \ solid drugs.  These also give broad and featureless XRD patterns, but actually\
    \ have order over a few nm lengthscale. /\nA major challenge in bringing drugs\
    \ to market in the amorphous form is the lack of a reliable method for fingerprinting,\
    \ let alone carrying out a more complete structural characterization of, these\
    \ materials.  We have recently been exploring whether total scattering atomic\
    \ pair distribution function methods (TSPDF) can alleviate this bottleneck.  TSPDF\
    \ uses short wavelength x-rays to obtain a scattering pattern of sufficient quality\
    \ that it can be Fourier transformed to obtain a meaningful real-space pair distribution\
    \ function that shows the distribution of atomic distances in the solid. We found\
    \ that the approach is highly promising and provides additional information not\
    \ available in a conventional XRD approach in the case of amorphous API's.  I\
    \ will describe the method and show our results on a range of materials from more\
    \ simple to more complex molecules.  It is possible to differentiate truly amorphous\
    \ from nanocrystalline forms and learn a surprising amount about the underlying\
    \ molecular packing"

  abstract: The origins of the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) technique go
    all the way back to the Debye scattering equation in 1915 and its incorporation
    in the language of correlation functions through the work of Zernike and Prins
    in the 1920's.  It was used somewhat as the method of last resort in the study
    of disordered systems and liquids, playing an important role but in a somewhat
    niche environment. With the advent of more powerful computers and new sources
    of radiation (time of flight neutrons in particular) in the late 1980's and 1990's
    the method had a reawakening, being applied to study disorder in crystalline materials.  Again,
    important impacts resulted, but it was still very much a niche and highly specialized
    technique, beloved of physicists (and not all of them by any means) but not too
    much beyond. Some early experiments using high energy x-rays at CHESS were successful
    at moving the method to the x-ray platform, but the big breakthrough came in the
    mid 2000s when quantitatively accurate PDFs were obtained with large area 2D detectors
    at APS in Chicago, allowing data to be collected 10,000x faster.  This opened
    up the method as a useful characterization technique for chemists, materials scientists,
    earth scientists and more lately pharmaceutical scientists.  Now the PDF technique
    is being widely adopted across disciplines from cultural heritage to earth science
    to catalysis, battery materials and pharmaceuticals.In fact, anywhere where disorder
    and nanoscale structures are valued in materials, the PDF is having an impact.
    And disorder and nanoscale structures are valued pretty much everywhere. There
    are multiple beamlines dedicated to the technique around the world, and software
    programs are becoming widely available and easier to use, easing access to the
    method.  Moving forward we project the method's adoption and applications to grow
    enormously.  In this talk I will describe, as I see it, the events that have given
    rise to this phenomenal growth.  I will review where I think we are with the technique
    and the exciting possibilities that are just now emerging that will, hopefully
    be a launchpad for even more impacts and growth in the power of the method and
    the scientific questions it can address.

  abstract: A revolution in materials science followed the invention of x-ray crystallography
    at the beginning of the 20th century.  The importance of knowing the structure
    of a material cannot be overstated. Yet we still struggle to solve the structures
    of nanoscale finite objects, though powerful new methods are emerging. We have
    been thinking about this problem by looking at the mathematical underpinnings
    of the problem beyond the crystallographic case, where translational symmetry
    and the resulting space-groups provide a sound theoretical foundation for studying
    the problem. Starting from a graph-theoretic representation, and treating structures
    as a point cloud in Euclidean space, we can couch the nanostructure inverse problem
    (NIP) in terms of a distance geometry problem. The kind of information obtained
    in a scattering experiment is effectively an unassigned list of distances (the
    pair distribution function). Solving the NIP then becomes the task of discovering
    the assignments of nodes and edges on the graph, and then finding an embedding
    in Euclidean space.  This is the so-called unassigned distance geometry problem
    (uDPG).  In this presentation I will describe this, and explain some algorithms
    that then present themselves for solving the problem.  I will discuss limitations
    that are becoming apparent but will present some practical solutions and directions
    that look promising.

  abstract: The discovery of new materials involves prediction of novel materials
    with useful properties.  However, beyond that, we need also to reliably predict
    the synthesis 'recipe' that we will use to make those novel materials. This is
    an extremely difficult challenge because, especially for inorganic materials there
    currently is no computational physics model for synthesis, which is an inherently
    kinetic, non-thermodynamic and irreversible process.  I will describe how we can
    take a machine learning approach to the problem, but critically we are missing
    experimental synthesis data for the algorithms to be trained on. There is a critical
    role for light-sources, coupled to advanced computation, to play in rectifying
    this problem.  I will discuss current progress, but mostly the possibilities and
    challenges.

  abstract: 'One of the remarkable properties of strongly interacting systems is the
    metal-insulator transition (MIT): MIT materials can change from metals to insulators
    as a function of an external perturbing parameter such as temperature, composition,
    pressure and so on.  Why this is remarkable is that it implies a rather huge modification
    of the electronic states driven by a rather tiny perturbation.  Such colossal
    responses to small perturbations are characteristic of systems that are in a critical
    state, a kind of physics that is associated with earthquakes, sand-piles, and
    pedestrian crossings.  It is characteristic of underlying correlations that are
    dynamic and not long-range ordered, but which can be driven and modified by the
    perturbations.  It turns out that these underlying correlations, which may involve
    electronic, magnetic, and/or structural degrees of freedom, can be energetically
    robust, but fleeting, elusive and surprisingly difficult to find experimentally
    (and theoretically) and consequently are routinely missed and barely studied.  I
    will describe recent results on a system that could become a textbook example
    of this phenomenon, CuIr2S4, which has been studied for many years, but where
    it is only by using the latest local structural methods and some pretty dogged
    forensics are we beginning to piece together the complete picture. What we are
    learning in this system has implications across the much broader universe of MIT
    materials in general and could help us to gain a broader understanding of this
    phenomenon.'

  abstract: The natural and physical sciences increasingly need streaming data processing
    for live data analysis and autonomous experimentation. Furthermore, data provenance
    and replicability are important to assure the veracity of scientific results.
    Here we describe a software system that combines high performance computing, streaming
    data processing, and automatic data provenance capturing to address this need.
    Data provenance and streaming data processing share a common data structure, the
    directed acyclic graph (DAG), which describes the order of each computational
    step. Data processing requires the DAG to specify what computations to run in
    what order, and the execution can be recreated from the graph, reproducing the
    analyzed data and capturing provenance. In our framework the description and ordering
    of the analysis steps (the pipeline) are separated from their execution (the streaming
    analysis) and the DAG created for the streaming data processing is captured during
    data analysis. Streaming data can have high throughputs and our system allows
    users to choose among multiple parallel processing backends, including Dask. To
    guarantee reproducibility, unique links to the incoming data, and their timestamps
    are captured alongside the DAG. Analyzed data, along with provenance metadata,
    are stored in a database, which can re-run analysis from raw data, enabling verification
    of results, exploring how parameters change outcomes, and data processing reuse.
    This system is running in production at the National Synchrotron Light Source-II
    (NSLS-II) x-ray powder diffraction beamlines.

  abstract: Nanoparticle superlattice assemblies (NPSA) are being developed for their
    special properties in applications such as flat-panel displays. The properties
    of the resulting assemblies can be further engineered by controlling interparticle
    spacings and arrangements. It is therefore crucial to be able to determine the
    structure of these NPSAs as quantitatively and accurately as possible. In general,
    they may have only short-range (on the nanoparticle length-scale) structural correlations
    (though some assemblies are highly crystalline), making the quantitative determination
    of NPSA structure difficult. TEM is popular for visualizing mesoscopic structures.
    Small angle scattering (SAS) may also be applied. However, conventional analysis
    of SAS data as so far resulted only in semi-quantitative analyses and TEM images
    can be subjected to sample bias and are not suitable for sample-average measurements.
    Atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of x-ray and neutron powder diffraction
    data is a powerful approach for studying non-periodic structural signals, for
    example from nanoparticles themselves. It yields local structural information
    from nanomaterials with high precision and quantitative accuracy. Here we describe
    how have extended the PDF analysis to the SAS regime, where we can apply similar
    quantitative modelling methods that are proving powerful at the atomic scale,
    but to the extraction of structural information about superlattice assemblies.
    In this presentation, we will present PDF analysis in SAS regime (sasPDF) and
    we will also present applications of sasPDF techniques to systems with different
    levels of ordering, from highly crystalline assemblies to isotropic, amorphous
    polymer coated silica nanoparticles that have promise in gas separation membranes.

  abstract: Autonomous experiments have three major parts, data acquisition, data
    analysis, and feedback. While all three are crucial to performing the experiment,
    the data analysis portion may be the most challenging. The data analysis must
    take raw data, produce meaningful quantities of interest, and translate them into
    actionable experimental parameters. Importantly all of this must be done live.
    In this talk I will discuss our approach to streaming data analysis for x-ray
    total scattering measurements, using analysis pipelining programs we have written,
    streamz and SHED. Streamz and SHED provide a simple, powerful, and easy to use
    way to build streaming data processing protocols in python. The SHED system also
    provides seamless data provenance with minimal user input. Finally we'll discuss
    the application of these pipelines to kriging driven autonomous experimentation
    for discovering novel glass forming alloys via atomic pair distribution function
    analysis.

  abstract: Defects, nanoscale structures, interfaces, surfaces, or multi-scale heterogeneities
    in materials have important impacts on materials properties but are difficult
    to study. Pair distribution Function (PDF) analysis of x-ray and neutron powder
    diffraction data is a powerful approach for studying such non-periodic structural
    signals. However, the degraded information obtained in experiments from defective
    materials introduces challenges in both modeling and experimental interpretation
    during PDF analysis. From the modeling aspect, we need a way of generating models
    that capture signals emerging from the imperfections, and from the experimental
    aspect, a systematic approach to quantify information content encapsulated in
    the measured signals is needed. In this presentation, I will introduce a machine-learning
    aided approach of generating candidate structures used in PDF analysis and I will
    also propose a statistics approach for quantifying uncertainties of information
    extracted from PDF analysis.

1811sob_mrs:
  abstract: Accurate determination of the structure of noble metallic nanomaterials
    is a key step towards understanding and controlling their properties. This is
    especially challenging for small particles, below 10 nm, where x-ray diffraction
    data is often broad and diffuse and not amenable to quantitative crystallographic
    analysis. In these cases a better approach is the use of atomic pair distribution
    function (PDF) analysis of synchrotron x-ray total scattering data. Even in this
    case, extracting detailed models of nanoparticle cores is notoriously difficult.
    Nanoparticle models based on close packed crystallographic cores, often simple
    but at times elaborate, lead to characteristically poor or unreliable fits. We
    collected PDF data for 12 metallic nanostructured samples, both elemental and
    alloyed, prepared using different synthesis methods, with significantly different
    shapes and sizes as disparate as 2 nm wires and 40 nm particles, using different
    synchrotron sources and beamlines. We found that previously ignored signals in
    residuals (difference curves) from PDF fits of close-packed models can be explained
    as originating from well defined domain structures in the nanoparticle cores,
    and that most of the materials studied were significantly better described using
    small multiply-twinned clusters. The methodology is able to provide rapid screening
    of non-crystallographic cluster motifs when modelling PDF data from metallic nanomaterials.

  abstract: the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) method is gaining popularity
    because of its ability to yield quantitative information about nanoscale atomic
    structures of materials.   The advent of advanced neutron and synchrotron-based
    x-ray sources, coupled with advanced computing and a growing need to understand
    the structure of nanostructured materials is fueling the rapid growth in the technique.   We
    recently demonstrated that it is possible, using hard x-rays, to combine PDF with
    computed tomography to make maps of nanostructure in extended objects such as
    catalyst bodies and batteries.  This opens the door to studying nanostructure
    in real functioning devices, even with the possibility of doing this under operando
    conditions with the device functioning.  In this talk I will explain the method
    and show results from a number of systems.  The method has not been applied in
    the context of neutrons but I will speculate on how it can be extended to this
    probe, and invite discussions from the community on this topic.

  abstract: The scientific literature has served mankind valiantly for more than 350
    years, resulting in scientific and technological revolutions in areas from energy
    and food to healthcare and the environmnent, resulting in a life for modern humans
    that would be completely unrecognizable to people in the late 17th century when
    the first journals were founded. This happened following many millenia of human
    development over which life changed little.  What was the recipe for such success?  The
    basic recipe is to create incentives to share knowledge freely, and to have safeguards
    in place that ensure standards of quality and veracity in the knowledge base are
    maintained. The latter was provided by peer review, a somewhat strained and maligned
    activity these days, but its importance in getting us to where we are today should
    not be undervalued, and moving forward, not undermined. As we move into the 21st
    century this structure is under strain.  The sheer amount of information being
    generated is unprecedented, making quality assurance a challenge, and some of
    the incentives have become distorted, such that weaving good yarns in high profile
    journals is valued over careful and thorough scholarship.  Leaving aside the last
    point, a new development is that increasingly it is not only humans that are the
    target audience of the scientific journals, but also computers.  In the past,
    sharing knowledge openly meant writing words on paper, placing numbers in tables
    and representing data in pretty figures that conveyed meaning to a human.  We
    are gradually training machines to read our literature through the process of
    Natural Language Processing, but I would rather take a different view which is
    to ask whether we can make our journals in a language and form that may be read
    by machines in the first place.  This is not to say that they won't also be read
    by humans, but I see a critical need to develop journals whose product, the journal
    articles, may be read by both humans and machines, without the need to teach the
    machines how to read a human language.  This is similar to the FACT and FAIR concepts
    at the heart of this workshop, but this way of thinking can go beyond parallel
    universes of databases and journal articles to something that blends these together
    and results in a more reproducible and more easily shared and reused scientific
    literature for the 21st century.

  type: seminar
1910sb_harvard:
  abstract: Materials in 21st century applications are increasingly complex, nano-
    and meso-structured, heterogeneous and defective.  We seek to engineer exactly
    this complexity to get the high performance that we desire from the materials.  Not
    only that, functional materials generally change their structure when they are
    functioning, and so studying the structural complexity as a function of time during
    device operation becomes critical.  What hasn't changed in the 21st century is
    that the properties of the materials derive from their atomic arrangements, and
    it is therefore crucial to be able to control and characterize atomic arrangements
    on all the length-scales relevant to the properties in question.  Properties depend
    on bond-length changes on picometer length-scales, which makes the challenge all
    the more intense. We have ever improving experimental and theoretical tools to
    tackle this challenge, and I will describe recent developments in x-ray and neutron
    scattering to that give us such picometer precision insights into nanoscale structures
    in both ex-situ and in-situ environments.  A consequence of these developments
    is that we need to start thinking about structure in a less conventional way.  Our
    understanding is embedded in the language of crystallography and space-groups,
    or point symmetries relevant to isolated molecules.  What we actually have in
    general is something in between, something I call clusterography, and we need
    to start thinking about how properties emerge from these multi-scale systems that
    are intermediate.

  abstract: Researchers are investigating ever more complex materials, including nanomaterials.  These
    are not amenable to traditional crystallographic analysis so it is difficult to
    solve the structure, yet as with conventional materials, the structure is a key
    determinant of the properties.  I will describe modern methods, called atomic
    pair distribution function (PDF) methods, that are being developed for addressing
    exactly this problem.  The methods are based on x-ray diffraction, which can be
    done on a properly set up laboratory x-ray instrument or at at an international
    synchrotron facility, in person or through a mail-in process. I will illustrate
    the use of the method to answer interesting scientific quesionts from energy materials
    to pharmaceuticals.  I will also describe how you can get started characterizing
    your materials with PDF even if you don't have a synchrotron at your University
    (which you probably don't!)

  abstract: Everything is made of atoms, and the properties of everything depends
    sensitively on the arrangement of those atoms.  This is called the structure-property
    relationship.  Often, nature likes to arrange the atoms in symmetric patterns,
    and the first step of the task of determining the atomic arrangement of a new
    material is to find these patterns.  This turns out to be a classification problem
    because of group theory.  There is a finite, countable, number of ways of combining
    symmetry elements in a way that allows atoms to fill space in a periodic array,
    which is the nature of the crystalline state.  These are called space-groups and
    there are exactly 230 of them.  In a structure determination, the first step is
    to measure x-ray diffraction data from the material, then to determine the space-group
    (and unit cell) of the structure based on that, then finally to place the atoms
    in the cell, respecting all the symmetries.  The first step, determining the space-group,
    was not possible for nanomaterials but we recently showed that a CNN could be
    trained to classify the measured signals into the right space-groups with good
    fidelity and I will present this.  I will also lay out a new challenge which is
    to solve the material synthesis inverse problem from precious data.  We have no
    results from this, but I would love to get feedback and help from the group!

  abstract: We live in the age of data science and machine learning.  The scientific
    community has been a bit slow to embrace this new world, but they are catching
    on.  So how does one leverage these new tools and how can we catapult our beloved
    synchrotron to play a leadership role in this new world?  The first steps are
    to try and help automate data reduction and feature extraction from images and
    I sense that this is underway.  However, the biggest gains that will be made possible
    if data analytic tools can be leveraged into completely novel scientific results
    using data analytics.  To do this, we need our data in structured, machine-readable
    databases, but more importantly, we need it to be tagged with scientifically relevant
    metadata.  How do we capture this without sending our users crazy?  I will talk
    about some first steps that we have been taking with the xpdAn software, and related
    tools, at the XPD and PDF beamlines, in close collaboration with the DAMA group.  The
    software is in production at these two beamlines and seems to be well liked by
    users, though there are still challenges to realize the vision of machine learning
    from the data.  Nonetheless, I think that this direction is important and I want
    to raise awareness more broadly about why we are doing it, what we hope to achieve,
    and why you might want to think about it for your own work.

  abstract: Pair Distribution Function analysis (PDF) has become a popular characterization
    technique over the last decades as it provides an intuitive way of characterizing
    materials on to the nanoscale. However, PDF modelling is both time-consuming and
    restricted to domain experts. We here propose a modelling technique based on a
    generative machine learning algorithm. This allows scientists for rapid time resolved
    structure characterization using x-ray data without being experts in data modelling.
    By using a conditional generative based algorithm characterization of structures
    can exceed the limitations of current structure databases. Currently structure
    characterization require tedious manual work where only selected models are tested.
    To overcome this manual and time consuming step a machine learning based method
    seem promising. The aim is to learn a generative model to predict structural motifs
    based on PDF data. This method has the capability of being extended to include
    data from complimentary experimental techniques.

  abstract: In a world of "big-data", the best way to encode information about chemical
    synthesis is under debate. Currently, databases typically define materials based
    on their structure, where for crystalline solids it is standardized in crystallographic
    forms using CIF - crystallographic information framework. We define a sample as
    the set of steps that were taken to produce the sample. Using directed acyclic
    graph (DAG) representation, with nodes as actions linked by a sequence that is
    encoded edges that join the nodes, opens up the possibility to use computational
    tools. We call this representation MOSY, or MOvement MOtivated SYnthesis. Linking
    characterization data, such as diffraction, calorimetric and optical spectra,
    to the point in the graph where the characterization was carried out, will provide
    the sample’s property a natural time and process dependence that is currently
    neglected. This is hopefully will result in a better mapping of materials and
    acceleration of their discovery.

  abstract: The sparsity of experimental data remains one of the biggest challenges
    for applying machine learning techniques in the materials science area. Here we
    present a new cloud-based nanostructure data analysis platform, PDFitc (PDF in
    the cloud), at https://pdfitc.org, which provides a solution to collect experimental
    diffraction data on synthesized materials all over the world. A potential use-case
    is structure-mining, which automatically screens large numbers of stuctures against
    uploaded experimental atomic pair distributionfunction (PDF) data without human
    intervention. Tests on various material systems show the effectiveness and robustness
    of the algorithm in finding the correct atomic crystal structure. It works on
    crystalline and nanocrystalline materials including complex oxide nanoparticles
    and nanowires, low-symmetry and locally distorted structures, and complicated
    doped and magnetic materials. This cloud platform could greatly speed up the data
    collection procedure and enable the possibility of training more future machine
    learning applications for material scientists.

  abstract: "The nanostructure inverse problem (NIP) aims to answer the following\
    \  question: given a diffraction pattern from a nanostructured material, what\
    \ is the 3D arrangement of atoms that gave rise to it?  It seems that it the same\
    \ as the 'crystal structure inverse problem' that is (largely) solved by the powerful\
    \ methods of crystallography.  However, a number of aspects make this problem\
    \ much more challenging.  First, it is difficult or impossible to get a 3D pattern\
    \ from a single nanoparticle or nanodomain often forcing us to solve the problem\
    \ from nano-powder-data, which greatly degrades the information content in the\
    \ data.  Second, the resulting structural models are more complex than those from\
    \ regular crystals because, beyond the location of atoms in a well defined unit\
    \ cell, it is necesaary to specify the nature of aperiodic deviations from the\
    \ average (for example, position dependent bond-lengths, surface relaxations and\
    \ dressing, etc.), and to specify morphological aspects of the nanoparticles and\
    \ nanodomains.  The reduction in information content in the data, coupled with\
    \ the increase in the complexity of the resulting models make these problems often\
    \ ill-posed with no unique, correct,  solution. Nonetheless, the fundamental importance\
    \ of the structure-property relationship in materials means that solve this problem\
    \ we must, and with picometer precision.\nIn this talk I will discuss some changes\
    \ in approach to the the problem that we have recently been exploring that take\
    \ us in the direction of the use of data analytics, machine learning, and artificial\
    \ intelligence.  These approaches have had a powerful impact in commerce and our\
    \ online life, but less so in materials science.  The attraction of these approaches\
    \ is that they are inherently well tuned to handle ill-posed statistical problems\
    \ such as the NIP, but it will require a change how we approach the analysis of\
    \ these problems.  I will discuss our initial steps in this direction and propose\
    \ a path forward."

  abstract: "Purpose: Increasingly, it is becoming necessary to formulate pharmaceuticals\
    \ with the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in complex forms such as nanocrystalline\
    \ or in the amorphous state, and often in a composite with other amorphous excipients.\
    \ The amorphous states is characterized by a broad and largely featureless XRD\
    \ pattern, the so-called 'amorphous halo', devoid of Bragg-peaks due to the lack\
    \ of long-range order in the packing. The nanoparticulate state also results in\
    \ broad and featureless XRD patterns, but actually has molecular packing order\
    \ over a few nm length-scale.\nA major challenge in bringing drugs to market in\
    \ the amorphous form is the lack of a reliable method for fingerprinting, let\
    \ alone carrying out a more complete structural characterization of these materials.\
    \  We have recently been exploring whether total scattering atomic pair distribution\
    \ function methods (TSPDF) [1] can alleviate this bottleneck.\nMethod: TSPDF uses\
    \ short wavelength x-rays to obtain a scattering pattern of sufficient quality\
    \ that it can be Fourier transformed to obtain a meaningful real-space pair distribution\
    \ function (PDF).  The PDF is a representation of the distribution of atomic distances\
    \ in the solid. For molecular materials there is an intra-molecular contribution\
    \ that yields information about the geometry of the molecules themselves.  There\
    \ is also an inter-molecular contribution that shows how the molecules pack together\
    \ in the solid state.\nResults: For crystalline materials there is a well-defined\
    \ inter-molecular signal that shows the crystal structure of the particular form\
    \ of the material.  For amorphous or liquid state materials, the intermolecular\
    \ part will tend to average to zero, the intra-molecular component will survive.\
    \  Even in the amorphous and liquid states, if there is a preference towards a\
    \ certain specific local packing of the molecules, this will be evident in the\
    \ PDF, yielding valuable information.  For example, in a recent study (unpublished)\
    \ we were able to detect that two differently amorphized products from the same\
    \ molecule had slightly different hydrogen bonding networks.  It was also possible\
    \ to observe metastable intermediates during the recrystallization of amorphous\
    \ lactose [3] We have found that the approach yields detailed quantitative information\
    \ about small molecule systems not available in a conventional XRD approach including\
    \ quantification of amorphous components [4].\nWe have recently further developed\
    \ the methods to be able to study objects in space- and time-resolved ways which\
    \ will allow mapping of amorphous constituents. I will describe the method and\
    \ show our results on a range of materials from more simple to more complex molecules.\
    \  It is possible to differentiate truly amorphous from nanocrystalline forms\
    \ and learn a surprising amount about the underlying packing\nReferences: [1]\

  abstract: The sparsity of experimental data remains one of the biggest challenges
    for applying machine learning techniques in the materials science area. Here we
    present a new cloud-based nanostructure data analysis platform, PDFitc (PDF in
    the cloud), at https://pdfitc.org, which provides a solution to collect experimental
    diffraction data on synthesized materials all over the world. A potential use-case
    is structure-mining, which automatically screens large numbers of stuctures against
    uploaded experimental atomic pair distributionfunction (PDF) data without human
    intervention. Tests on various material systems show the effectiveness and robustness
    of the algorithm in finding the correct atomic crystal structure. It works on
    crystalline and nanocrystalline materials including complex oxide nanoparticles
    and nanowires, low-symmetry and locally distorted structures, and complicated
    doped and magnetic materials. This cloud platform could greatly speed up the data
    collection procedure and enable the possibility of training more future machine
    learning applications for material scientists.

  abstract: Here we present a new approach to obtain candidate structures from neutron
    and x-ray atomic pair distribution function (PDF) data in a highly automated way.
    It pulls, from structural databases, all the structures meeting the search criteria
    and performs structure refinements on them without human intervention. Tests on
    various material systems show the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm
    in finding the correct atomic crystal structure.  It works on crystalline and
    nanocrystalline materials including complex oxide nanoparticles and nanowires,
    low-symmetry and locally distorted structures, and complicated doped and magnetic
    materials. The approach has been tested on x-ray data, but also the testing cases
    include the neutron PDF data collected at the NOMAD beamline of the SNS. This
    approach could greatly reduce the traditional structure searching work and enable
    the possibility of high-throughput real-time automated analysis of PDF experiments
    in the future. Structure-mining will become available on a cloud-based PDF analysis
    platform, PDFitc (PDF in the cloud), at https://pdfitc.org. L.Y. and M.G.T. acknowledge

  abstract: Theory, experiments and simulations, are the three known ways for discovering
    new materials. These ways brought us to the point we are now; but can we do better?
    Nowdays, where computers have (almost) unlimited storange capacity and computerional
    power, data can be harvested, stored and analized in no-time. The goal is to development
    a "global-intuition" on how to synthesize known mateirals, which then teach us,
    using machine-learning, to discover new functional materials. I will talk about
    why and how we, as scientists and computer-scitists, should embrce the (fourth)
    data-driven scientific approach in order to discover new functional materials,
    and the chalenges we are facing in turning old habbits into our favor.

  abstract: Nanostructures have gained a significant increase in attention due to
    their “different” properties compared to their bulk counterparts1. The Pair Distribution
    Function analysis (PDF) has become an increasingly popular characterization technique
    for nanoparticles as it provides an intuitive way of obtaining structural information2.
    Through in situ PDF data atomic rearrangement during syntheses can be followed
    on a timescale of seconds. However, PDF modelling is both time-consuming and restricted
    to domain experts. We here propose a modelling technique based on a generative
    machine learning algorithm. This allows scientists for rapid time resolved structure
    characterization using x-ray data without being experts in data modelling. By
    using a conditional generative based algorithm characterization of structures
    can exceed the limitations of current structure databases. Currently, structure
    characterization required tedious manual work where only selected models are tested.
    With the continues improvement of synchrotrons time resolution and data quality
    are increasing, this also means that there are a staggering amount of data to
    analyze. To overcome this manual and time consuming step a machine learning based
    method seem promising. The aim is to learn a generative model to predict structural
    motifs based on PDF data. This will allow scientists with little experience in
    PDF modeling to characterize larger in situ PDF studies instantaneous. This method
    has earlier been used to generate organic molecules conditioned on specific desired

  abstract: Recently, experiments have begun to indicate that broken symmetries that
    are not long-range ordered but local in nature, andwhich may be fluctuating, are
    widespread in transition metals, robust in thatthey exist over wide ranges of
    temperature and composition, and have significant impacts on the material properties.
    They are difficult to detect by conventional measurements sensitive tolong-range
    order, which is why they have been largely overlooked until the pastfew years,
    but that doesn’t mean that they are not important to the physics ofthe materials.
    They can produce gaps in the electronic structure that are large, and in a number
    of cases studied to date are important, but previously overlooked, precursors
    to insulator-metaltransitions, charge density wave states, nematicity, and more.
    These broken symmetries are now thought to be electronically driven, removing
    orbital degeneracies. One example is the well-known Jahn Teller effect, though
    it is acting locally even in crystalline materials, but other orbital degeneracy
    breaking mechanisms such as covalency between neighboring metal ions have also
    been observed, which can result in oligomer formation within solid materials.
    In this talk I will describe the discovery of this interesting phenomenon we call
    "Orbital Degeneracy Lifting (ODL)", speculate on how widespread it may be, and
    some implications for the materials properties.

2012hv_columbiauniversity:
  abstract: Being able to determine the symmetry information, such as space group,
    based on the atomic pair-distribution function (PDF) will lead to more possibilities
    of solving structures from a wider class of material. Recently, machine learning
    (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool with great predictive power in different fields
    such as image classification. Thus, our goal is to develop a ML model capable
    of predicting the space group of a structure from the calculated or measured PDF
    with high accuracy. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) takes
    the PDF data as the input and outputs the corresponding space group. The model
    was trained with PDF calculated from 101,802 structures from the ICSD, falling
    into 45 most common space groups that account for 80% of the inorganic structures.
    The trained model was then tested with experimental PDF data reported in literature.
    The model presented yields promising result in that it correctly identifies the
    space group among the top-6 estimates 91.9% of the time. The CNN model also successfully
    identifies space groups for 12 out of 15 experimental PDFs. Interesting aspects
    of the failed estimates indicate that the CNN is failing in similar ways as conventional
    indexing algorithms applied to conventional powder diffraction data. This preliminary
    success of the CNN model shows the possibility of model-independent assessment
    of PDF data on a wide class of materials.

  abstract: Crystals are periodically long-range ordered arrays of atoms.  But crystals
    are not always as they seem.  For sure, they have a long-range ordered component
    that is encoded in their Bragg scattering signal.  But what if this is just an
    average over different local atomic arrangements.  Does that happen? How does
    it happen? If it happens, how can we detect it and why is this only news now.
    And finally, if it does happen, who cares?  In this talk I will explore this phenomenon
    in a number of different systems and show that, (1) it happens much more often
    than we probably realize. (2) it does matter, it can turn metals into insulators
    for example, (3) it can have different origins, from boring steric effects to
    orbital degeneracy lifting, lone pair effects, local covalency, and even interesting
    steric effects (the hybrid perovskites!).  Finally, I will discuss some (but not
    all) the methods we can use to detect it, and why we are only figuring this out
    now (spoiler alert, it is hard to detect).

    but could be useful in other applications. The methods have been tested on a TiO2
    boule grown in an optical float-zone furnace. The approach applies a statistical
    filter to polycrystalline diffraction patterns on two-dimensional (2D) detectors
    to rapidly determine the degree of powder quality of the signal. When larger crystals
    emerge in the growth, their position, size, and shape can be tracked using an
    automated blob-tracking algorithm that follows individual Bragg peaks as a function
    of position in a grid scan, even when multiple crystals are contributing spots
    to diffraction images. This method is found to be robust as the same crystal shape
    can be independently reconstructed using different sets of Bragg reflections.
    Image segmentation methods are then used to map out the polycrystalline grains.
    We also note that other information about crystal quality, such as mosaicity or
    strain state, may be inferred and mapped from the intensity variation of the Bragg
    peaks at different locations within the sample.

  abstract: Increased data rates are great.  Who doesn't want more, better, data?
    But we need help to keep up with all this high velocity data. As well as the data
    coming more quickly, it is also coming in more abstract form.  Gone are the days
    when a Bragg peak appears in front of our eyes as we measure each point individually.  Instead
    we have a 2D image that needs multiple steps of preanalysis before it is interpretable.   I
    will discuss our activities to address these issues working with scientists at
    sector 28 at NSLS-II.  AI and Machine Learning methods are beginning to play a
    role at all steps of the process and will have large impacts moving forward as
    more and more processes use them to automate and extract more information from
    the data.  I will present examples where statistical and ML methods have had impacts
    at all points along the analysis and data interpretation chain.
