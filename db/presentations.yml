  abstract: Modern materials under study for next generation technologies, such as
    for energy conversion and storage, environmental remediation and health, are highly
    complex, often heterogeneous and nano-structured.  A full understanding of the
    structure requires us to go beyond crystallography and to study the local aperiodic
    components of the structure, which is a major experimental challenge. Among these
    tools are total scattering at atomic pair distribution function (PDF) methods
    which use diffuse and Bragg scattering to give information about short and intermediate
    range structure in nanomaterials and bulk materials. These methods involve a significant
    amount of signal averaging and information loss due to limited structural coherence
    and non-ideal samples.  Nonetheless, they are critical for understanding nanomaterials
    and are growing in popularity. I will introduce these methods and discuss some
    of the uncertainties associated with modeling and uncertainty estimation and quantification.

  abstract: 'Increasingly we seek smarter ways to deliver therapies in a targeted
    way.  Nanoscience can play an important role in this endeavor and many researchers
    are exploring ways to engineer materials at the nanoscale to get formulations
    for such targeted deliveries. But to do this safely and effectively it is crucial
    to be able to characterize the materials at the atomic scale.  This is difficult
    because of the nanostructure problem, our inability to determine with accuracy
    the arrangements of atoms when those arrangements extend only on nanometer length-scales.  Coming
    from the physics community, the atomic pair distribution function analysis of
    x-ray and neutron powder diffraction is having huge impacts in studies of nanomaterials.  In
    recent developments we were able to extend this to weakly scattering systems,
    dilute systems and molecular systems, making this an ideal tool for studying organics
    and formulations.  The latest x-ray sources and the latest computational methods
    for data analysis and modeling are giving us an unprecedented view into atomic
    arrangements at the nanoscale in organics, pharmaceuticals and excipients.  The
    ability to measure with spatial and temporal resolution is allowing us to visualize
    heterogeneous materials and probe nanostructure inside solid objects.  This talk
    will be a tour of the nanostructure characterization landscape state of the art.  '

  abstract: "In the solid state, small molecules such as active pharmaceutical ingredient\
    \ (API) molecules tend to pack in well defined arrangements leading to different\
    \ crystalline polymorphs. An alternative solid form, increasingly of interest\
    \ in the pharmaceutical industry, is the amorphous state. This state is characterized\
    \ by a broad and largely featureless XRD pattern, the so-called  'amorphous halo',\
    \ devoid of Bragg-peaks due to the lack of long-range order in the packing. There\
    \ is a further, intermediate situation, which that of ultra-small nanoparticulate\
    \ solid drugs.  These also give broad and featureless XRD patterns, but actually\
    \ have order over a few nm lengthscale. /\nA major challenge in bringing drugs\
    \ to market in the amorphous form is the lack of a reliable method for fingerprinting,\
    \ let alone carrying out a more complete structural characterization of, these\
    \ materials.  We have recently been exploring whether total scattering atomic\
    \ pair distribution function methods (TSPDF) can alleviate this bottleneck.  TSPDF\
    \ uses short wavelength x-rays to obtain a scattering pattern of sufficient quality\
    \ that it can be Fourier transformed to obtain a meaningful real-space pair distribution\
    \ function that shows the distribution of atomic distances in the solid. We found\
    \ that the approach is highly promising and provides additional information not\
    \ available in a conventional XRD approach in the case of amorphous API's.  I\
    \ will describe the method and show our results on a range of materials from more\
    \ simple to more complex molecules.  It is possible to differentiate truly amorphous\
    \ from nanocrystalline forms and learn a surprising amount about the underlying\
    \ molecular packing"

  abstract: The origins of the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) technique go
    all the way back to the Debye scattering equation in 1915 and its incorporation
    in the language of correlation functions through the work of Zernike and Prins
    in the 1920's.  It was used somewhat as the method of last resort in the study
    of disordered systems and liquids, playing an important role but in a somewhat
    niche environment. With the advent of more powerful computers and new sources
    of radiation (time of flight neutrons in particular) in the late 1980's and 1990's
    the method had a reawakening, being applied to study disorder in crystalline materials.  Again,
    important impacts resulted, but it was still very much a niche and highly specialized
    technique, beloved of physicists (and not all of them by any means) but not too
    much beyond. Some early experiments using high energy x-rays at CHESS were successful
    at moving the method to the x-ray platform, but the big breakthrough came in the
    mid 2000s when quantitatively accurate PDFs were obtained with large area 2D detectors
    at APS in Chicago, allowing data to be collected 10,000x faster.  This opened
    up the method as a useful characterization technique for chemists, materials scientists,
    earth scientists and more lately pharmaceutical scientists.  Now the PDF technique
    is being widely adopted across disciplines from cultural heritage to earth science
    to catalysis, battery materials and pharmaceuticals.In fact, anywhere where disorder
    and nanoscale structures are valued in materials, the PDF is having an impact.
    And disorder and nanoscale structures are valued pretty much everywhere. There
    are multiple beamlines dedicated to the technique around the world, and software
    programs are becoming widely available and easier to use, easing access to the
    method.  Moving forward we project the method's adoption and applications to grow
    enormously.  In this talk I will describe, as I see it, the events that have given
    rise to this phenomenal growth.  I will review where I think we are with the technique
    and the exciting possibilities that are just now emerging that will, hopefully
    be a launchpad for even more impacts and growth in the power of the method and
    the scientific questions it can address.

  abstract: A revolution in materials science followed the invention of x-ray crystallography
    at the beginning of the 20th century.  The importance of knowing the structure
    of a material cannot be overstated. Yet we still struggle to solve the structures
    of nanoscale finite objects, though powerful new methods are emerging. We have
    been thinking about this problem by looking at the mathematical underpinnings
    of the problem beyond the crystallographic case, where translational symmetry
    and the resulting space-groups provide a sound theoretical foundation for studying
    the problem. Starting from a graph-theoretic representation, and treating structures
    as a point cloud in Euclidean space, we can couch the nanostructure inverse problem
    (NIP) in terms of a distance geometry problem. The kind of information obtained
    in a scattering experiment is effectively an unassigned list of distances (the
    pair distribution function). Solving the NIP then becomes the task of discovering
    the assignments of nodes and edges on the graph, and then finding an embedding
    in Euclidean space.  This is the so-called unassigned distance geometry problem
    (uDPG).  In this presentation I will describe this, and explain some algorithms
    that then present themselves for solving the problem.  I will discuss limitations
    that are becoming apparent but will present some practical solutions and directions
    that look promising.

  abstract: The discovery of new materials involves prediction of novel materials
    with useful properties.  However, beyond that, we need also to reliably predict
    the synthesis 'recipe' that we will use to make those novel materials. This is
    an extremely difficult challenge because, especially for inorganic materials there
    currently is no computational physics model for synthesis, which is an inherently
    kinetic, non-thermodynamic and irreversible process.  I will describe how we can
    take a machine learning approach to the problem, but critically we are missing
    experimental synthesis data for the algorithms to be trained on. There is a critical
    role for light-sources, coupled to advanced computation, to play in rectifying
    this problem.  I will discuss current progress, but mostly the possibilities and
    challenges.

  abstract: 'One of the remarkable properties of strongly interacting systems is the
    metal-insulator transition (MIT): MIT materials can change from metals to insulators
    as a function of an external perturbing parameter such as temperature, composition,
    pressure and so on.  Why this is remarkable is that it implies a rather huge modification
    of the electronic states driven by a rather tiny perturbation.  Such colossal
    responses to small perturbations are characteristic of systems that are in a critical
    state, a kind of physics that is associated with earthquakes, sand-piles, and
    pedestrian crossings.  It is characteristic of underlying correlations that are
    dynamic and not long-range ordered, but which can be driven and modified by the
    perturbations.  It turns out that these underlying correlations, which may involve
    electronic, magnetic, and/or structural degrees of freedom, can be energetically
    robust, but fleeting, elusive and surprisingly difficult to find experimentally
    (and theoretically) and consequently are routinely missed and barely studied.  I
    will describe recent results on a system that could become a textbook example
    of this phenomenon, CuIr2S4, which has been studied for many years, but where
    it is only by using the latest local structural methods and some pretty dogged
    forensics are we beginning to piece together the complete picture. What we are
    learning in this system has implications across the much broader universe of MIT
    materials in general and could help us to gain a broader understanding of this
    phenomenon.'

  abstract: The natural and physical sciences increasingly need streaming data processing
    for live data analysis and autonomous experimentation. Furthermore, data provenance
    and replicability are important to assure the veracity of scientific results.
    Here we describe a software system that combines high performance computing, streaming
    data processing, and automatic data provenance capturing to address this need.
    Data provenance and streaming data processing share a common data structure, the
    directed acyclic graph (DAG), which describes the order of each computational
    step. Data processing requires the DAG to specify what computations to run in
    what order, and the execution can be recreated from the graph, reproducing the
    analyzed data and capturing provenance. In our framework the description and ordering
    of the analysis steps (the pipeline) are separated from their execution (the streaming
    analysis) and the DAG created for the streaming data processing is captured during
    data analysis. Streaming data can have high throughputs and our system allows
    users to choose among multiple parallel processing backends, including Dask. To
    guarantee reproducibility, unique links to the incoming data, and their timestamps
    are captured alongside the DAG. Analyzed data, along with provenance metadata,
    are stored in a database, which can re-run analysis from raw data, enabling verification
    of results, exploring how parameters change outcomes, and data processing reuse.
    This system is running in production at the National Synchrotron Light Source-II
    (NSLS-II) x-ray powder diffraction beamlines.

  abstract: Nanoparticle superlattice assemblies (NPSA) are being developed for their
    special properties in applications such as flat-panel displays. The properties
    of the resulting assemblies can be further engineered by controlling interparticle
    spacings and arrangements. It is therefore crucial to be able to determine the
    structure of these NPSAs as quantitatively and accurately as possible. In general,
    they may have only short-range (on the nanoparticle length-scale) structural correlations
    (though some assemblies are highly crystalline), making the quantitative determination
    of NPSA structure difficult. TEM is popular for visualizing mesoscopic structures.
    Small angle scattering (SAS) may also be applied. However, conventional analysis
    of SAS data as so far resulted only in semi-quantitative analyses and TEM images
    can be subjected to sample bias and are not suitable for sample-average measurements.
    Atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of x-ray and neutron powder diffraction
    data is a powerful approach for studying non-periodic structural signals, for
    example from nanoparticles themselves. It yields local structural information
    from nanomaterials with high precision and quantitative accuracy. Here we describe
    how have extended the PDF analysis to the SAS regime, where we can apply similar
    quantitative modelling methods that are proving powerful at the atomic scale,
    but to the extraction of structural information about superlattice assemblies.
    In this presentation, we will present PDF analysis in SAS regime (sasPDF) and
    we will also present applications of sasPDF techniques to systems with different
    levels of ordering, from highly crystalline assemblies to isotropic, amorphous
    polymer coated silica nanoparticles that have promise in gas separation membranes.

  abstract: Autonomous experiments have three major parts, data acquisition, data
    analysis, and feedback. While all three are crucial to performing the experiment,
    the data analysis portion may be the most challenging. The data analysis must
    take raw data, produce meaningful quantities of interest, and translate them into
    actionable experimental parameters. Importantly all of this must be done live.
    In this talk I will discuss our approach to streaming data analysis for x-ray
    total scattering measurements, using analysis pipelining programs we have written,
    streamz and SHED. Streamz and SHED provide a simple, powerful, and easy to use
    way to build streaming data processing protocols in python. The SHED system also
    provides seamless data provenance with minimal user input. Finally we'll discuss
    the application of these pipelines to kriging driven autonomous experimentation
    for discovering novel glass forming alloys via atomic pair distribution function
    analysis.

  abstract: Defects, nanoscale structures, interfaces, surfaces, or multi-scale heterogeneities
    in materials have important impacts on materials properties but are difficult
    to study. Pair distribution Function (PDF) analysis of x-ray and neutron powder
    diffraction data is a powerful approach for studying such non-periodic structural
    signals. However, the degraded information obtained in experiments from defective
    materials introduces challenges in both modeling and experimental interpretation
    during PDF analysis. From the modeling aspect, we need a way of generating models
    that capture signals emerging from the imperfections, and from the experimental
    aspect, a systematic approach to quantify information content encapsulated in
    the measured signals is needed. In this presentation, I will introduce a machine-learning
    aided approach of generating candidate structures used in PDF analysis and I will
    also propose a statistics approach for quantifying uncertainties of information
    extracted from PDF analysis.

1811sob_mrs:
  abstract: Accurate determination of the structure of noble metallic nanomaterials
    is a key step towards understanding and controlling their properties. This is
    especially challenging for small particles, below 10 nm, where x-ray diffraction
    data is often broad and diffuse and not amenable to quantitative crystallographic
    analysis. In these cases a better approach is the use of atomic pair distribution
    function (PDF) analysis of synchrotron x-ray total scattering data. Even in this
    case, extracting detailed models of nanoparticle cores is notoriously difficult.
    Nanoparticle models based on close packed crystallographic cores, often simple
    but at times elaborate, lead to characteristically poor or unreliable fits. We
    collected PDF data for 12 metallic nanostructured samples, both elemental and
    alloyed, prepared using different synthesis methods, with significantly different
    shapes and sizes as disparate as 2 nm wires and 40 nm particles, using different
    synchrotron sources and beamlines. We found that previously ignored signals in
    residuals (difference curves) from PDF fits of close-packed models can be explained
    as originating from well defined domain structures in the nanoparticle cores,
    and that most of the materials studied were significantly better described using
    small multiply-twinned clusters. The methodology is able to provide rapid screening
    of non-crystallographic cluster motifs when modelling PDF data from metallic nanomaterials.

  abstract: the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) method is gaining popularity
    because of its ability to yield quantitative information about nanoscale atomic
    structures of materials.   The advent of advanced neutron and synchrotron-based
    x-ray sources, coupled with advanced computing and a growing need to understand
    the structure of nanostructured materials is fueling the rapid growth in the technique.   We
    recently demonstrated that it is possible, using hard x-rays, to combine PDF with
    computed tomography to make maps of nanostructure in extended objects such as
    catalyst bodies and batteries.  This opens the door to studying nanostructure
    in real functioning devices, even with the possibility of doing this under operando
    conditions with the device functioning.  In this talk I will explain the method
    and show results from a number of systems.  The method has not been applied in
    the context of neutrons but I will speculate on how it can be extended to this
    probe, and invite discussions from the community on this topic.

1908sb_ecmAI:
  abstract: The scientific literature has served mankind valiantly for more than 350
    years, resulting in scientific and technological revolutions in areas from energy
    and food to healthcare and the environmnent, resulting in a life for modern humans
    that would be completely unrecognizable to people in the late 17th century when
    the first journals were founded. This happened following many millenia of human
    development over which life changed little.  What was the recipe for such success?  The
    basic recipe is to create incentives to share knowledge freely, and to have safeguards
    in place that ensure standards of quality and veracity in the knowledge base are
    maintained. The latter was provided by peer review, a somewhat strained and maligned
    activity these days, but its importance in getting us to where we are today should
    not be undervalued, and moving forward, not undermined. As we move into the 21st
    century this structure is under strain.  The sheer amount of information being
    generated is unprecedented, making quality assurance a challenge, and some of
    the incentives have become distorted, such that weaving good yarns in high profile
    journals is valued over careful and thorough scholarship.  Leaving aside the last
    point, a new development is that increasingly it is not only humans that are the
    target audience of the scientific journals, but also computers.  In the past,
    sharing knowledge openly meant writing words on paper, placing numbers in tables
    and representing data in pretty figures that conveyed meaning to a human.  We
    are gradually training machines to read our literature through the process of
    Natural Language Processing, but I would rather take a different view which is
    to ask whether we can make our journals in a language and form that may be read
    by machines in the first place.  This is not to say that they won't also be read
    by humans, but I see a critical need to develop journals whose product, the journal
    articles, may be read by both humans and machines, without the need to teach the
    machines how to read a human language.  This is similar to the FACT and FAIR concepts
    at the heart of this workshop, but this way of thinking can go beyond parallel
    universes of databases and journal articles to something that blends these together
    and results in a more reproducible and more easily shared and reused scientific
    literature for the 21st century.

    scattering measurements
  type: seminar
1910sb_harvard:
  abstract: Materials in 21st century applications are increasingly complex, nano-
    and meso-structured, heterogeneous and defective.  We seek to engineer exactly
    this complexity to get the high performance that we desire from the materials.  Not
    only that, functional materials generally change their structure when they are
    functioning, and so studying the structural complexity as a function of time during
    device operation becomes critical.  What hasn't changed in the 21st century is
    that the properties of the materials derive from their atomic arrangements, and
    it is therefore crucial to be able to control and characterize atomic arrangements
    on all the length-scales relevant to the properties in question.  Properties depend
    on bond-length changes on picometer length-scales, which makes the challenge all
    the more intense. We have ever improving experimental and theoretical tools to
    tackle this challenge, and I will describe recent developments in x-ray and neutron
    scattering to that give us such picometer precision insights into nanoscale structures
    in both ex-situ and in-situ environments.  A consequence of these developments
    is that we need to start thinking about structure in a less conventional way.  Our
    understanding is embedded in the language of crystallography and space-groups,
    or point symmetries relevant to isolated molecules.  What we actually have in
    general is something in between, something I call clusterography, and we need
    to start thinking about how properties emerge from these multi-scale systems that
    are intermediate.

  abstract: Researchers are investigating ever more complex materials, including nanomaterials.  These
    are not amenable to traditional crystallographic analysis so it is difficult to
    solve the structure, yet as with conventional materials, the structure is a key
    determinant of the properties.  I will describe modern methods, called atomic
    pair distribution function (PDF) methods, that are being developed for addressing
    exactly this problem.  The methods are based on x-ray diffraction, which can be
    done on a properly set up laboratory x-ray instrument or at at an international
    synchrotron facility, in person or through a mail-in process. I will illustrate
    the use of the method to answer interesting scientific quesionts from energy materials
    to pharmaceuticals.  I will also describe how you can get started characterizing
    your materials with PDF even if you don't have a synchrotron at your University
    (which you probably don't!)

2002sb_ColumbiaUniversity:
  abstract: Everything is made of atoms, and the properties of everything depends
    sensitively on the arrangement of those atoms.  This is called the structure-property
    relationship.  Often, nature likes to arrange the atoms in symmetric patterns,
    and the first step of the task of determining the atomic arrangement of a new
    material is to find these patterns.  This turns out to be a classification problem
    because of group theory.  There is a finite, countable, number of ways of combining
    symmetry elements in a way that allows atoms to fill space in a periodic array,
    which is the nature of the crystalline state.  These are called space-groups and
    there are exactly 230 of them.  In a structure determination, the first step is
    to measure x-ray diffraction data from the material, then to determine the space-group
    (and unit cell) of the structure based on that, then finally to place the atoms
    in the cell, respecting all the symmetries.  The first step, determining the space-group,
    was not possible for nanomaterials but we recently showed that a CNN could be
    trained to classify the measured signals into the right space-groups with good
    fidelity and I will present this.  I will also lay out a new challenge which is
    to solve the material synthesis inverse problem from precious data.  We have no
    results from this, but I would love to get feedback and help from the group!

  abstract: We live in the age of data science and machine learning.  The scientific
    community has been a bit slow to embrace this new world, but they are catching
    on.  So how does one leverage these new tools and how can we catapult our beloved
    synchrotron to play a leadership role in this new world?  The first steps are
    to try and help automate data reduction and feature extraction from images and
    I sense that this is underway.  However, the biggest gains that will be made possible
    if data analytic tools can be leveraged into completely novel scientific results
    using data analytics.  To do this, we need our data in structured, machine-readable
    databases, but more importantly, we need it to be tagged with scientifically relevant
    metadata.  How do we capture this without sending our users crazy?  I will talk
    about some first steps that we have been taking with the xpdAn software, and related
    tools, at the XPD and PDF beamlines, in close collaboration with the DAMA group.  The
    software is in production at these two beamlines and seems to be well liked by
    users, though there are still challenges to realize the vision of machine learning
    from the data.  Nonetheless, I think that this direction is important and I want
    to raise awareness more broadly about why we are doing it, what we hope to achieve,
    and why you might want to think about it for your own work.

  abstract: Pair Distribution Function analysis (PDF) has become a popular characterization
    technique over the last decades as it provides an intuitive way of characterizing
    materials on to the nanoscale. However, PDF modelling is both time-consuming and
    restricted to domain experts. We here propose a modelling technique based on a
    generative machine learning algorithm. This allows scientists for rapid time resolved
    structure characterization using x-ray data without being experts in data modelling.
    By using a conditional generative based algorithm characterization of structures
    can exceed the limitations of current structure databases. Currently structure
    characterization require tedious manual work where only selected models are tested.
    To overcome this manual and time consuming step a machine learning based method
    seem promising. The aim is to learn a generative model to predict structural motifs
    based on PDF data. This method has the capability of being extended to include
    data from complimentary experimental techniques.

  abstract: In a world of "big-data", the best way to encode information about chemical
    synthesis is under debate. Currently, databases typically define materials based
    on their structure, where for crystalline solids it is standardized in crystallographic
    forms using CIF - crystallographic information framework. We define a sample as
    the set of steps that were taken to produce the sample. Using directed acyclic
    graph (DAG) representation, with nodes as actions linked by a sequence that is
    encoded edges that join the nodes, opens up the possibility to use computational
    tools. We call this representation MOSY, or MOvement MOtivated SYnthesis. Linking
    characterization data, such as diffraction, calorimetric and optical spectra,
    to the point in the graph where the characterization was carried out, will provide
    the sample’s property a natural time and process dependence that is currently
    neglected. This is hopefully will result in a better mapping of materials and
    acceleration of their discovery.

  abstract: "The nanostructure inverse problem (NIP) aims to answer the following\
    \  question: given a diffraction pattern from a nanostructured material, what\
    \ is the 3D arrangement of atoms that gave rise to it?  It seems that it the same\
    \ as the 'crystal structure inverse problem' that is (largely) solved by the powerful\
    \ methods of crystallography.  However, a number of aspects make this problem\
    \ much more challenging.  First, it is difficult or impossible to get a 3D pattern\
    \ from a single nanoparticle or nanodomain often forcing us to solve the problem\
    \ from nano-powder-data, which greatly degrades the information content in the\
    \ data.  Second, the resulting structural models are more complex than those from\
    \ regular crystals because, beyond the location of atoms in a well defined unit\
    \ cell, it is necesaary to specify the nature of aperiodic deviations from the\
    \ average (for example, position dependent bond-lengths, surface relaxations and\
    \ dressing, etc.), and to specify morphological aspects of the nanoparticles and\
    \ nanodomains.  The reduction in information content in the data, coupled with\
    \ the increase in the complexity of the resulting models make these problems often\
    \ ill-posed with no unique, correct,  solution. Nonetheless, the fundamental importance\
    \ of the structure-property relationship in materials means that solve this problem\
    \ we must, and with picometer precision.\nIn this talk I will discuss some changes\
    \ in approach to the the problem that we have recently been exploring that take\
    \ us in the direction of the use of data analytics, machine learning, and artificial\
    \ intelligence.  These approaches have had a powerful impact in commerce and our\
    \ online life, but less so in materials science.  The attraction of these approaches\
    \ is that they are inherently well tuned to handle ill-posed statistical problems\
    \ such as the NIP, but it will require a change how we approach the analysis of\
    \ these problems.  I will discuss our initial steps in this direction and propose\
    \ a path forward."

    materials. The approach has been tested on x-ray data, but also the testing cases
    include the neutron PDF data collected at the NOMAD beamline of the SNS. This
    approach could greatly reduce the traditional structure searching work and enable
    the possibility of high-throughput real-time automated analysis of PDF experiments
    in the future. Structure-mining will become available on a cloud-based PDF analysis

  abstract: Theory, experiments and simulations, are the three known ways for discovering
    new materials. These ways brought us to the point we are now; but can we do better?
    Nowdays, where computers have (almost) unlimited storange capacity and computerional
    power, data can be harvested, stored and analized in no-time. The goal is to development
    a "global-intuition" on how to synthesize known mateirals, which then teach us,
    using machine-learning, to discover new functional materials. I will talk about
    why and how we, as scientists and computer-scitists, should embrce the (fourth)
    data-driven scientific approach in order to discover new functional materials,
    and the chalenges we are facing in turning old habbits into our favor.

  abstract: Recently, experiments have begun to indicate that broken symmetries that
    are not long-range ordered but local in nature, andwhich may be fluctuating, are
    widespread in transition metals, robust in thatthey exist over wide ranges of
    temperature and composition, and have significant impacts on the material properties.
    They are difficult to detect by conventional measurements sensitive tolong-range
    order, which is why they have been largely overlooked until the pastfew years,
    but that doesn’t mean that they are not important to the physics ofthe materials.
    They can produce gaps in the electronic structure that are large, and in a number
    of cases studied to date are important, but previously overlooked, precursors
    to insulator-metaltransitions, charge density wave states, nematicity, and more.
    These broken symmetries are now thought to be electronically driven, removing
    orbital degeneracies. One example is the well-known Jahn Teller effect, though
    it is acting locally even in crystalline materials, but other orbital degeneracy
    breaking mechanisms such as covalency between neighboring metal ions have also
    been observed, which can result in oligomer formation within solid materials.
    In this talk I will describe the discovery of this interesting phenomenon we call
    "Orbital Degeneracy Lifting (ODL)", speculate on how widespread it may be, and
    some implications for the materials properties.

  abstract: Being able to determine the symmetry information, such as space group,
    based on the atomic pair-distribution function (PDF) will lead to more possibilities
    of solving structures from a wider class of material. Recently, machine learning
    (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool with great predictive power in different fields
    such as image classification. Thus, our goal is to develop a ML model capable
    of predicting the space group of a structure from the calculated or measured PDF
    with high accuracy. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) takes
    the PDF data as the input and outputs the corresponding space group. The model
    was trained with PDF calculated from 101,802 structures from the ICSD, falling
    into 45 most common space groups that account for 80% of the inorganic structures.
    The trained model was then tested with experimental PDF data reported in literature.
    The model presented yields promising result in that it correctly identifies the
    space group among the top-6 estimates 91.9% of the time. The CNN model also successfully
    identifies space groups for 12 out of 15 experimental PDFs. Interesting aspects
    of the failed estimates indicate that the CNN is failing in similar ways as conventional
    indexing algorithms applied to conventional powder diffraction data. This preliminary
    success of the CNN model shows the possibility of model-independent assessment
    of PDF data on a wide class of materials.

  abstract: Crystals are periodically long-range ordered arrays of atoms.  But crystals
    are not always as they seem.  For sure, they have a long-range ordered component
    that is encoded in their Bragg scattering signal.  But what if this is just an
    average over different local atomic arrangements.  Does that happen? How does
    it happen? If it happens, how can we detect it and why is this only news now.
    And finally, if it does happen, who cares?  In this talk I will explore this phenomenon
    in a number of different systems and show that, (1) it happens much more often
    than we probably realize. (2) it does matter, it can turn metals into insulators
    for example, (3) it can have different origins, from boring steric effects to
    orbital degeneracy lifting, lone pair effects, local covalency, and even interesting
    steric effects (the hybrid perovskites!).  Finally, I will discuss some (but not
    all) the methods we can use to detect it, and why we are only figuring this out
    now (spoiler alert, it is hard to detect).

  abstract: Here, we present an automated and rapid method for nondestructive mapping
    of crystal grains in a rod-shaped sample. The approach was designed for application
    to in situ float-zone crystal growth experiments at an X-ray synchrotron source
    but could be useful in other applications. The methods have been tested on a TiO2
    boule grown in an optical float-zone furnace. The approach applies a statistical
    filter to polycrystalline diffraction patterns on two-dimensional (2D) detectors
    to rapidly determine the degree of powder quality of the signal. When larger crystals
    emerge in the growth, their position, size, and shape can be tracked using an
    automated blob-tracking algorithm that follows individual Bragg peaks as a function
    of position in a grid scan, even when multiple crystals are contributing spots
    to diffraction images. This method is found to be robust as the same crystal shape
    can be independently reconstructed using different sets of Bragg reflections.
    Image segmentation methods are then used to map out the polycrystalline grains.
    We also note that other information about crystal quality, such as mosaicity or
    strain state, may be inferred and mapped from the intensity variation of the Bragg
    peaks at different locations within the sample.

  abstract: Increased data rates are great.  Who doesn't want more, better, data?
    But we need help to keep up with all this high velocity data. As well as the data
    coming more quickly, it is also coming in more abstract form.  Gone are the days
    when a Bragg peak appears in front of our eyes as we measure each point individually.  Instead
    we have a 2D image that needs multiple steps of preanalysis before it is interpretable.   I
    will discuss our activities to address these issues working with scientists at
    sector 28 at NSLS-II.  AI and Machine Learning methods are beginning to play a
    role at all steps of the process and will have large impacts moving forward as
    more and more processes use them to automate and extract more information from
    the data.  I will present examples where statistical and ML methods have had impacts
    at all points along the analysis and data interpretation chain.

  abstract: Modern materials under study for next generation technologies, such as
    for energy conversion and storage,   environmental remediation and health, are
    highly complex, often heterogeneous and nano structured.  A full understanding
    of the structure requires us to go beyond crystallography and to study the local
    structure, which is a major experimental challenge. There are recently emerging
    powerful experimental developments, for example, using the atomic pair distribution
    function technique (PDF), among others. I will describe the structural insights
    that can be obtained from heterogenous nanostructured components such as electrodes
    and electrolytes in fuel cells and batteries and thermoelectrics. These approaches
    can yield quantitative information such as thermodynamic parameters that help

    of the devices.  I will discuss early developments of these methods that made
    use of newly emerging pulsed neutron sources in the 1980's and 1990's, the advantages

2106sb_universityofminnesotacenterforquantummaterials:
  abstract: Modern materials under study for next generation technologies, such as
    for energy conversion and storage,   environmental remediation and health, are
    highly complex, often heterogeneous and nano structured.  A full understanding
    of the structure requires us to go beyond crystallography and to study the local
    structure, which is a major experimental challenge. There are recently emerging
    powerful experimental developments, for example, using the atomic pair distribution
    function technique (PDF), among others.  In this talk I will focus on  bulk materials
    that have distorted local structures, a potentially large class of materials where,
    nonetheless this property has been largely overlooked.  In particular, I will
    focus on materials where atomic or bonding orbitals are electronically active,
    driving the local atomic distortions. I will describe a new language we are developing
    for classifying these materials, and new modeling tools that are under development
    to reveal the local structures.  I will also mention areas that need addressing
    in this endeavor.

  abstract: "When doing structural refinements of total scattering data from highly\
    \ crystalline compounds, one starts by choosing an atomic model and then imposing\
    \ constraints that dictate how the atoms are allowed to move. These constraints\
    \ are typically based on space group symmetry. The resulting structure representation\
    \ is useful and accurate for a large range of compounds, however, it has its limitations\
    \ for materials with a significant amount of disorder. It is particularly necessary\
    \ to accurately describe this disorder when fitting total scattering data in the\
    \ real space as pair distribution functions. To represent such disordered, but\
    \ still significantly crystalline compounds, one would ideally want to fit the\
    \ data with a ‘big-box’ model containing anything from a hundred to a few thousand\
    \ atoms. Unfortunately, this can lead to a large number of variables to refine\
    \ and an overfitting of the data with meaningless results. Alternatively, it is\
    \ possible to construct models where multiple atoms are constrained to move in\
    \ a collective fashion, controlled by a small number of variables [1,2]. Here\
    \ we present one such approach, relying on our a priori knowledge of the structure\
    \ at hand. For oxides with perovskite structure, ABO3, we know that they tend\
    \ to distort in ways that keep the BO6 octahedra intact. The resulting distortions\
    \ can therefore often be described by one of 23 unique tilting patterns of the\
    \ rigid octahedra, identified by Glazer in the '70s [3]. Fitting a model of any\
    \ of the tilting patterns to scattering data requires refinement of no more than\
    \ four variables at once – one lattice parameter and a maximum of three tilt amplitudes.\
    \ We have implemented this approach into diffpy-CMI, a flexible tool for fitting\
    \ pair distribution function data. Using the method, we analyse a series of scattering\
    \ data from well-known perovskites and determine their degree and type of structural\
    \ tilting disorder. [1] Sartbaeva, A. ‘Quadrupolar Ordering in LaMnO3 Revealed\

  abstract: In recent years, Electron Diffraction, and especially the 4D-STEM [2]
    is growingly becoming a routine part of structural characterizations of materials
    at the nano-scale. Its un-matched spatial resolution (down to sub-nm) enables
    the exploration of local variations within a sample, which alternatively is averaged
    over the entire irradiated sampled area, when explored, for example, by x-rays.
    As often shown in electron microscope, samples are often heterogeneous, and consequently
    their local properties, which then reflect on the average behavior of the material,
    composite, or device. Besides morphology and composition, the local structural
    order can vary, especially in evolving systems. In this study, we explore how
    far we can take electron diffraction when the interest is in the evolution of
    materials. We challenge ourselves with mapping the local structure in a composite
    of crystalline Ni and amorphous Zr-Cu-Ni-Al Bulk Metallic Glass (BMG) that was
    fused into a composite via hot-rolling [2]. Using a fast camera looking through
    the fluorescence screen, we captured diffraction patterns in a 4D-STEM modality,
    where we captured diffraction patterns coupled with beam precession with 3 nm
    step size in a Ni/BMG/Ni cross-section sample that was cut from the composite
    - in total 131x289 diffraction patterns. Using the collected diffraction patterns
    and tailoring automated data reduction and analysis pipelines, such as auto-masking,
    azimuthal-integration, Fourier-transformation to get the electron Pair Distribution
    Function (ePDF) and various fittings of the PDF, we were efficiently deriving
    a large set of physically meaningful scalars, which we generalize as Quantities
    of Interest, or QoI of a scanning nano-structure electron microscopy (SNEM). Using
    different QoI's (see Figure)- those derived directly form the images, such as
    virtual-dark-field and mostly from ePDF's, we could map out most clearly Ni/BMG
    boundaries, visualize inter-diffusion between Ni and BMG, extract regions of formed
    nano-crystals within the BMG, follow compositional changes via the average bond-distance
    (verified with EELS from the same area) and extract the distribution of atomic
    pairs. We were also able to map the deviation of each pixel within the BMG from
    an expected structural model, which exposed the BMG/Ni inter-diffusion front.
    Finally, we could estimate the effective local structure of the nano-crystalline
    inclusions within the BMG as FCC structures. Using an assembly of these results
    we could learn that nano-crystalline inclusions within the BMG are located in
    regions where Cu is deficient and Zr is in excess. Most importantly, we learn
    the origin of success in forming the Ni/BMG composite via hot-rolling, which is
    nonetheless, a challenging goal. Hot rolling is found to be a challenging process
    due to the excessive formation of nano-crystallites at the Ni/BMG interface. Here,
    however, the assembly of SNEM results suggested that the metallic Ni amorphized
    instead of the BMG--Ni crystallize at the BMG/Ni interface. These results emphasize
    the richness SNEM experiments hide, and with the assistance of automated (and
    in the future - autonomated) pipelines can expose the story of evolving systems.

  abstract: Total Scattering and atomic pair distribution function analysis continues
    to have important scientific impacts in nanoscience, sustainable energy and beyond.  The
    advent of powerful sources of x-rays, neutrons and electrons mean that increasing
    complicated experimental scenarios can be studied in quasi-real time, smaller
    and more dilute samples probed, and faster time-resolved experiments attempted.  These
    are fueled by the sources, but also by the development of experimental hardware
    capabilities at beamline end-stations and effective use of advanced data analysis
    and modeling approaches.  In this talk I will describe recent developments in
    all these regards, but with a focus on the data analysis and modeling, which are
    recently developed or under development.  These include the use of machine learning
    and streaming data analysis pipelines to take us towards quasi-real-time data
    analysis and modeling, leveraging cloud computing to develop software tools as
    a web service, and novel high throughput screening approaches to structural modeling,
    and what insights these may provide to chemists, physicists and materials scientists

  abstract: 'The inevitable and necessary green transition towards sustainable energy
    sources depends completely on the ability to store energy. One possibility is
    to store the excess energy from renewable energy sources electrochemically in
    rechargeable batteries. A possibility that has also been realized for the substitution
    of combustion engines in vehicles. To develop the rechargeable batteries of tomorrow,
    fundamental understanding of relations between material structure and properties
    is essential. Here, operando experiments are essential, as they provide insight
    into material behavior under the true dynamic conditions relevant for real applications.
    For the material structure at the atomic and nano length scales, x-rays, neutrons,
    and electrons are excellent probes. If materials are crystalline and well-ordered
    on the atomic and nano length scales, traditional diffraction methods are ideal
    to probe the long-range order of the material structure, as the relevant information
    lies in the Bragg peaks. In recent years, it has been realized that crystallinity
    is not a given for all battery materials at all states-of-charge or at all stages
    of a battery’s lifetime. However, for non-crystalline materials, whether they
    are nanocrystalline, disordered, or even amorphous, the more traditional diffraction
    methods fall short. Now, the relevant information does not lie in the Bragg peaks
    but underneath them in the diffuse scattering. To probe the material structure
    of crystallographically challenged materials, total scattering experiments, which
    involve both the Bragg and diffuse scattering, hold the key. From total scattering
    data, the reduced atomic pair distribution function (PDF) can be obtained, which
    takes the scattering data from reciprocal space and into real space. The PDF can
    be thought of as a probability distribution of the interatomic distances in the
    material and the very local structure down to nearest-neighbor distances in materials
    can now be probed. Everything is seen in the PDF, which is a blessing as well
    as a curse for battery scientists, as batteries are multicomponent systems with
    complicated PDFs, which calls for battery-specific PDF methodologies. This contribution
    will address how to obtain operando PDFs for battery materials during cycling
    and especially how to analyze data. In our studies, we utilize model-dependent
    PDF analysis, sometimes referred to as ‘real-space Rietveld refinement’, via a
    least-square optimization method, like Rietveld refinement, where an input model
    is refined against experimental data, such that the residual between the two is
    minimized. The user-friendly PDFgui and the more versatile and advanced DiffPy
    Complex Modelling Interface (DiffPy-CMI) software are two examples on tools to
    conduct model-dependent, quantitative PDF analysis. In addition, we employ novel
    tools for model-free PDF analysis. During summer 2021, ‘PDF in the cloud’ (PDFitc)
    was launched at ‘pdfitc.org’, where multiple apps for PDF analysis are available
    to users. This includes the model-free ‘similarityMapping’ app, which is a statistical
    analysis based on Pearson correlation. During fall 2021, another model-free statistical
    method will become available as an app: non-negative matrix factorization (NMF),

  abstract: 'Crystallographically  determined long-range ordered structures of materials
    are often taken for granted when investigating properties and functionalities.
    Although this simplifies our lives, there is a growing awareness of the fact that
    short-range deviations from the long-range order is not only common, but also
    determining for many of the properties, such as bandgap and magnetic order. As
    an example, many oxides with the perovskite structure have well-defined crystalline
    order, but their properties can in some cases be explained better if one accounts
    for local disorder. To be able to understand how properties are affected by the
    short-range deviations, or local structure, we first have to properly describe
    what that local structure looks like. Just as with long-range ordered crystal
    structures, we can determine the local structure using scattering experiments
    and subsequently fitting the data to models. To obtain the local structure, however,
    we must also analyze the diffuse scattering in addition to the Bragg scattering,
    which is best done in real space as the pair distribution function (PDF). We build
    on the many already existing PDF studies on perovskites and constrain our structure
    model further by taking advantage of the knowledge that the structure tends to
    distort in ways that keep its BO6 octahedra intact. The resulting distortions,
    collective or not, can therefore often be described by one of 23 unique tilting
    patterns of the rigid octahedra, identified by Glazer in the 70s [1]. In our implementation,
    fitting a model of any of the tilting patterns to scattering data requires refinement
    of no more than four variables at once – one lattice parameter and a maximum of
    three tilt amplitudes. Here we present our PDF analysis of a selection of perovskites
    and determine their degree and type of structural tilting disorder. PDF analysis
    and modeling in the Billinge group was supported by the U.S. National Science
    Foundation through grant DMREF-1922234. [1] Glazer, A. M. ‘The Classification

  abstract: Metal oxide nanoparticles have a number of important technological applications
    in electronic devices. In particular, titanium(IV) oxide nanoparticles have potential
    applications in lithium ion batteries. A particular synthesis challenge with titanium(IV)
    oxide nanoparticles is that it has multiple possible structural phases. Differentiating
    between the various phases is particularly challenging when they are nanoparticles
    and it is crucial to be able to identify the structural phases of synthesized
    nanoparticles. Beyond knowing the phase distribution in the sample, it is also
    important to study crystallite sizes and shapes, as well as the presence of common
    defects, since these factors have an important impact on the functionalities.
    X-ray atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis is an important and powerful
    tool to use for this purpose because it reveals the local structure on nanometer
    length-scales, revealing quantitative information about the structural phase,
    particle morphology and defects in nanoparticulate materials, which is beyond
    the capability of traditional x-ray diffraction methods when the nanoparticles
    are small (< 10nm in diameter). One of the common methods for studying nanoparticles
    using PDF analysis is to use attenuated crystal model (ACM) to test candidate
    structures and extract quantitative information about them. Given the growing
    importance of the PDF approach in nano-materials science and chemistry, we feel
    that it is helpful to the community to discuss the approach in a pedagogical way.
    Here we address a gap in the literature and present a detailed workflow for applying
    ACM in a robust and accurate way, using titanium(IV) oxide nanoparticles as an
    example. Using this approach we find that the nanoparticles contain the bronze
    phase as the major phase and the anatase phase as the minor phase, obtain the
    structural parameters of both phases, and that the particle sizes of the major
    phase are probably following a lognormal distribution. This work was supported
    by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences
    (DOE-BES) under contract No. DE-SC0012704.

  abstract: In recent years, Electron Diffraction, and especially the 4D-STEM [1]
    is growingly becoming a routine part of structural characterizations of materials
    at the nano-scale. Its un-matched spatial resolution (down to sub-nm) enables
    the exploration of local variations within a sample, which alternatively is averaged
    over the entire irradiated sampled area, when explored, for example, by x-rays.
    As often shown in electron-microscope, samples are often heterogeneous, and consequently
    their local properties, which then reflect on the average behavior of the material,
    composite, or device. Besides morphology and composition, the local structural
    order can vary, especially in evolving systems. In this study, we explore how
    far we can take electron diffraction when the interest is in the evolution of
    materials. We challenge ourselves with mapping the local structure in a composite
    of crystalline Ni and amorphous Zr-Cu-Ni-Al Bulk Metallic Glass (BMG) was fused
    into a composite via hot-rolling [2]. Using a fast camera looking through a fluorescence
    screen on which diffraction patterns are observed, we use scanning precession
    electron diffraction to captured 4D-STEM data with 3 nm step size from a FIB-fabricated
    Ni/BMG/Ni laminate. Using an automated data reduction and analysis pipelines,
    including distortion correction, auto-masking, azimuthal-integration, Fourier-transformation,
    and least-square function fitting, to get electron Pair Distribution Function
    (ePDF) and a set of structurally-meaningful features, which we generalize as Quantities
    of Interest (QoI). Since we use both the 2D diffraction patterns and the 1D-ePDF’s,
    we generalize the concept of mapping structurally-significant QoI’s derived from
    a spatially-correlated diffraction pattern as scanning nano-structure electron
    microscopy (SNEM). We use SNEM to generate QoI-based maps of, for example, the
    virtual-dark-field (VDF) from the 2D diffraction patterns, and the peak position,
    peak-width, and the goodness of fit to a structural model from the reduced ePDF’s.
    We find clear variations in structural features across the Ni/BMG interface, as
    well as within the BGM itself, which indicate the presence of nano-crystalline
    inclusions with higher structural correlation length, and evidence for variations
    in the degree of clustering of alike atoms (e.g., Zr-Zr) in the BMG, which indicate
    a varying short-range chemical order. We could also follow trends in compositional
    variations using the average interatomic bond-distance (as also verified with
    atomic fraction EELS maps) extract the distribution of atomic pairs, exposed the
    BMG/Ni inter-diffusion front, and estimate the effective local structure of the
    nano-crystalline inclusion within the BMG as an FCC structure.  Combining these
    results with atomic composition EELS maps, we learn that nano-crystalline inclusions
    within the BMG are located in Cu-deficient regions. We also learn that the formation
    of Ni/BMG composite via hot-rolling, which is often found to be challenging due
    to the excessive formation of nano-crystallites at the Ni/BMG interface has succeeded
    due to the metallic Ni being amorphized instead of [BMG--Ni] crystallites being
    formed. These results are an example of the richness SNEM can provide, and with
    the assistance of automated (and in the future - autonomated) pipelines, bring
    us closer to exposing (and potentially controlling) the history of heterogeneity
    in evolving systems. [1]  Xiaoke Mu, Andrey Mazilkin, Christian Sprau, Alexander

  abstract: A chemically complex matrix with the potential for chemical ordering distinguishes
    multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) from conventional alloys. As this pertains
    to mechanical behavior, a nominally disordered matrix presents a non-uniform energetic
    landscape for dislocation motion which can be modulated by varying degrees of
    ordering. Such energetics can lead to the development of microstructural features
    such as dislocation cells, twins, microbands, and martensite, the evolution of
    which are important in both in-service plastic response and the potential for
    tunable deformation processing. The present work investigates the effect of chemical
    short-range order (SRO) in FCC CoCrNi and BCC NbTiZr alloys on microstructural
    evolution due to high strain rate compression. Samples of each alloy were heat
    treated to induce different degrees of SRO and dynamically compressed via Kolsky
    (split-Hopkinson pressure) bar. Electron microscopy diffraction-based techniques
    are used to both measure the degree of chemical ordering as well as characterize
    the deformation substructure.

  abstract: Increased data rates are great.  Who doesn't want more, better, data?
    But we need help to keep up with all this high velocity data. As well as the data
    coming more quickly, it is also coming in more abstract form.  Gone are the days
    when a Bragg peak appears in front of our eyes as we measure each point individually.  Instead
    we have a 2D image that needs multiple steps of preanalysis before it is interpretable.   I
    will discuss our activities to address these issues working with scientists at
    sector 28 at NSLS-II.  AI and Machine Learning methods are beginning to play a
    role at all steps of the process and will have large impacts moving forward as
    more and more processes use them to automate and extract more information from
    the data.  I will present examples where statistical and ML methods have had impacts
    at all points along the analysis and data interpretation chain.

  abstract: Multi-principle element alloys (MPEAs), and specifically single-phase
    high entropy alloys (HEAs), offer a unique framework to study fundamental processes
    of deformation in metallic materials such as dislocation slip and mechanical twinning.  Owing
    to their chemical and structural disorder, the energetic landscape for deformation
    substructure formation is more complex when compared to conventional alloys. This
    can lead to different modes microstructural evolution and result in improved mechanical
    properties. Furthermore, the potential for the existence of short-range order
    (SRO) in these alloys may further modulate deformation energetics, which would
    enable tunability and order-based material design. The present work utilizes various
    electron diffraction-based methods to characterize both the presence of SRO after
    thermal treatment and the microstructural evolution due to quasistatic and dynamic
    compression.

  abstract: With the growing complexity of functional materials and chemical systems,
    we often find ourselves limited in our ability to fully represent the set of descriptors
    of a chemical system. In complex chemical systems, finding a complete crystallographic
    model that folds all the interatomic correlations using a small set of structural
    descriptors may not always be feasible or practical. Alternatively, one can take
    a data-driven approach and measure the relative changes in structural or chemical
    features (e.g, structural correlations, oxidation states). An experimental data-driven
    approach does not require complete models and enjoys the rapidly evolving machine-learning
    tool-set, which excel at classifying relational datasets and, if also labelled
    by an observed property, can provide predictive power that links system's descriptors
    with observed properties. I will focus on two types of complexities - (1) Hierarchical
    complexity, in which different types of structural or chemical correlations change
    change with the probed correlation length. For example, in ferroic materials different
    properties (e.g., mechanical, dielectric, optoelectronic) may depend differently
    on short- and long-range structural correlations. In multi-component alloys local
    chemical correlations (random-distribution, ordering, clustering) can affect corrosion
    and plasticity, but altogether show a single average structural phase. Since selected
    materials' properties depend on correlations at a specific hierarchical level,
    it is important to be able to isolate those from one another. (2) Evolutionary
    complexity, where the order changes over space and/or time. Nucleation, crystal
    growth,  intercalation - are examples for processes that involve evolutionary
    complexity and can also be found in batteries, heterogeneous catalysis and photovoltaics.
    Isolating and tracking order-related correlations in heterogeneous kinetically-stabilized
    or dynamically changing systems is, therefore, important for their more complete
    understanding, design and control. Total scattering and Pair Distribution Function
    (PDF) analysis are key methods for unfolding structural correlations at different
    correlation lengths. Using 4D-STEM to generate nm-resolution spatially-resolved
    electron-PDF data taken from hot-rolled Ni-laminated bulk-metallic-glass rakita2021mapping,
    I demonstrate how both hierarchical and evolutionary complexity can be uncovered
    and studied. Partially assisted with a machine-learning classification toolbox,
    we show how different aspects of the structural and chemical order, such as chemical-short-range-order,
    can be directly visualized as a function of position. In a different example~\cite{rakita2020active}
    I show how an evolutionary complex systems can be manipulated to achieve a desired
    chemical state. In this example we demonstrate an active reaction control of Cu
    redox state from real-time feedback from in-situ synchrotron measurements. While
    complexity can lead to a lack of control over a chemical system, it is essentially
    adding tuning-knobs that, once isolated, understood and controlled, can unlock
    new materials with desired functionalities.

    understanding, design and control. Total scattering and Pair Distribution Function
    (PDF) analysis are key methods for unfolding structural correlations at different
    correlation lengths. Using 4D-STEM to generate nm-resolution spatially-resolved
    electron-PDF data taken from hot-rolled Ni-laminated bulk-metallic-glass rakita2021mapping,
    I demonstrate how both hierarchical and evolutionary complexity can be uncovered
    and studied. Partially assisted with a machine-learning classification toolbox,
    we show how different aspects of the structural and chemical order, such as chemical-short-range-order,
    can be directly visualized as a function of position. In a different example~\cite{rakita2020active}
    I show how an evolutionary complex systems can be manipulated to achieve a desired
    chemical state. In this example we demonstrate an active reaction control of Cu
    redox state from real-time feedback from in-situ synchrotron measurements. While
    complexity can lead to a lack of control over a chemical system, it is essentially
    adding tuning-knobs that, once isolated, understood and controlled, can unlock
    new materials with desired functionalities.

  abstract: Increasingly we seek to move away from well ordered crystalline materials
    in high performance applications. This is also true in the world of pharmaceuticals
    where effective drug candidates may suffer from low solubility and low bioavailability
    in crystalline form, but show much better performance in the amorphous or nanocrystalline
    state.  Also, targeted drug delivery mechanisms have been envisaged that involve
    using nanoparticles as carriers. In all these cases we need tools that can characterize
    disordered and nanocrystalline materials.  I will describe the total scattering
    atomic pair distribution function (TSPDF) method which uses advance scattering
    of x-rays, electrons or neutrons for just this purpose.  With the advances in
    the power of sources, both large synchrotron based facilities and laboratory based
    systems, and data analysis methods and software, The TSPDF method has never been
    more powerful than now, allowing us to probe quantatively nanostructure in highly
    quantitative detail, from dilute and low scattering signals, in spatially resolved
    ways. I will describe recent developments and applications with examples from
    pharmaceuticals but also other scientific domains.

  abstract: With the growing structural and chemical complexity of functional materials,
    finding a complete crystallographic model that folds all the interatomic correlations
    using a small set of structural descriptors may not always be feasible or practical.
    Alternatively, one can use a data-driven approaches, where relational datasets
    are used to measure variations in the structure. Using relational Pair Distribution
    Function (PDF) data, one can reduce the contributions of systematic errors and
    allow one to follow the evolution of local strucutral motifs without the need
    in a complete strucutral model. Using the rapidly evolving machine-learning tools,
    realational PDF datasets can be used to disentangle partial structural motifs
    and their evolution. I will show examples from electron and x-ray total-scattering
    experiments, where relational PDF were used.

  abstract: Properties of real materials depend very sensitively on structural defects
    and deviations from ideal atomic arrangements.  These may be surfaces, interfaces,
    point defects and increasingly, nanostructuring and other types of structura disorder.  The
    materials under study for next generation technologies, such as for energy conversion
    and storage, environmental remediation and health, are therefore highly complex,
    often heterogeneous and nano structured.  A full understanding of the structure-property
    relationship requires us to go beyond crystallography and to study the local structure,
    which is a major experimental challenge. There are recently emerging powerful
    experimental developments, for example, using the atomic pair distribution function
    technique (PDF), among others. In this talk I will touch on nanoparticulate materials,
    amorphous organic and inorganic materials and nanoporous solids and liquids as
    well as bulk materials that have distorted local structures, a potentially large
    class of materials where, nonetheless this property has been largely overlooked.  In
    particular, I will focus on materials where atomic or bonding orbitals are electronically
    active, driving the local atomic distortions. I will present the approach and
    recent methodological advances in measurement and data analysis, and present exemplar
    scientific studies from various complex materials systems.

  abstract: "The nanostructure inverse problem (NIP) aims to answer the following\
    \  question: given a diffraction pattern from a nanostructured material, what\
    \ is the 3D arrangement of atoms that gave rise to it?  It seems that it the same\
    \ as the 'crystal structure inverse problem' that is (largely) solved by the powerful\
    \ methods of crystallography.  However, a number of aspects make this problem\
    \ much more challenging.  First, it is difficult or impossible to get a 3D pattern\
    \ from a single nanoparticle or nanodomain often forcing us to solve the problem\
    \ from nano-powder-data, which greatly degrades the information content in the\
    \ data.  Second, the resulting structural models are more complex than those from\
    \ regular crystals because, beyond the location of atoms in a well defined unit\
    \ cell, it is necesaary to specify the nature of aperiodic deviations from the\
    \ average (for example, position dependent bond-lengths, surface relaxations and\
    \ dressing, etc.), and to specify morphological aspects of the nanoparticles and\
    \ nanodomains.  The reduction in information content in the data, coupled with\
    \ the increase in the complexity of the resulting models make these problems often\
    \ ill-posed with no unique, correct,  solution. Nonetheless, the fundamental importance\
    \ of the structure-property relationship in materials means that solve this problem\
    \ we must, and with picometer precision.\nIn this talk I will discuss some changes\
    \ in approach to the the problem that we have recently been exploring that take\
    \ us in the direction of the use of data analytics, machine learning, and artificial\
    \ intelligence.  These approaches have had a powerful impact in commerce and our\
    \ online life, but less so in materials science.  The attraction of these approaches\
    \ is that they are inherently well tuned to handle ill-posed statistical problems\
    \ such as the NIP, but it will require a change how we approach the analysis of\
    \ these problems.  I will discuss our initial steps in this direction and propose\
    \ a path forward."

  abstract: Everything is made of atoms, and the properties of everything depends
    sensitively on the arrangement of those atoms.  This is called the structure-property
    relationship.  Often, nature likes to arrange the atoms in symmetric patterns,
    and the first step of the task of determining the atomic arrangement of a new
    material is to find these patterns.  This turns out to be a classification problem
    because of group theory.  There is a finite, countable, number of ways of combining
    symmetry elements in a way that allows atoms to fill space in a periodic array,
    which is the nature of the crystalline state.  These are called space-groups and
    there are exactly 230 of them.  In a structure determination, the first step is
    to measure x-ray diffraction data from the material, then to determine the space-group
    (and unit cell) of the structure based on that, then finally to place the atoms
    in the cell, respecting all the symmetries.  The first step, determining the space-group,
    was not possible for nanomaterials but we recently showed that a CNN could be
    trained to classify the measured signals into the right space-groups with good
    fidelity and I will present this.  Moving on from this success, we have been exploring
    machine learning solutions to actually obtain structural solutions (not just the
    symmetry of the structure), as well as other data analytic tools for manipulating
    the scattering data behind the nanostructure inverse problem.I will also lay out
    a new challenge which is to solve the material synthesis inverse problem from
    precious data.

  abstract: 'This presentation and the associated hands-on tutorial will introduce
    DiffPy-CMI, a software for structure analysis from experimental atomic Pair Distribution
    Function (PDF) and for Complex Modeling [1, 2].  DiffPy-CMI (Complex Modeling
    Infrastructure) has been developed to handle ill-posed inverse problems, where
    diffraction experiments do not provide enough signal to determine complicated
    structures or nanostructures.  To overcome this problem, we use a Complex Modeling
    approach [3] which allows users to combine additional experimental or theoretical
    inputs and uses them all together in a common optimization routine.  DiffPy-CMI
    is a flexible and extensible program allowing user to create such models tailored
    for the specific knowledge about the material under study.  DiffPy-CMI runs on
    Linux and Mac operating systems and is primarily written in Python with computationally
    intense parts coded in C++.  It can also be run on windows using the Windows Linux
    Subsystem (WSL). In the big picture DiffPy-CMI provides several ways of representing
    atomic structures, a set of forward calculators (e.g., PDF, bond valence sums,
    powder and single crystal diffraction), and finally a fit-manager to define and
    run multi-input refinements.  The fits can be conducted with short Python scripts
    or within the Jupyter Notebook interactive environment.  In addition to Complex
    Modeling, DiffPy-CMI also enables more subtle PDF refinements which are not possible
    in PDFgui [4] - for example PDF fits of non-periodic small clusters or of molecular
    crystals with rigid structure units.  The software provides access to internal
    simulation routines, which can be tweaked or extended, and thus permits rapid
    implementation of new ideas and more accurate models.  We will demonstrate the
    capabilities of DiffPy-CMI on a series of science cases, starting from simple
    forward calculations and following up with PDF fitting examples that go beyond
    PDFgui.  '

  abstract: 'There are recently emerging powerful experimental developments related
    to atomic pair distribution function (PDF) method and total-scattering studies.
    At this workshop you will learn in detail about carrying out and applying PDF
    to your own scientific research, and there will be excellent tutorial talks on
    this. Therefore, in this talk I will focus on recent technological and methodological
    developments, and some that are in the pipeline, that are allowing ever richer
    science to be done.  Examples include new spatial and time resolved capabilities
    and novel approaches to modeling. I will also talk about recent applications of
    PDF to scientific problems enabled by the new developments.  I will also describe
    recent and upcoming developments in PDF analysis and modeling software that are
    under development in the group. '

  abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful method for performing statistical
    learning on material science data. But Machine learning has not been used for
    extracting structural distortions, because it is hard to define distortion rigorously
    and it is also challenging to collect a clean and big enough dataset. In this
    project, we probe structural disorder using total scattering, transforming the
    data into real-space pair distribution function (PDF). And we build a 2-step machine
    learning algorithm to determine the octahedral tilts in perovskites.

2211sb_johannesburg,southafrica:
  abstract: It has long been a goal to obtain "atomic movies", where frames are captured
    showing how atoms rearrange during and after excitation.  To do this, we need
    a camera that can "see" atoms, with a shutter speed and a frame-rate on the femtosecond
    time-scales, the time-scale of atomic motions.   It has long been realized that
    diffraction is a way to see atoms, and XFELs allow us to do diffraction in a stroboscopic
    mode on femtosecond timescales.  If you have a well defined crystal, you can use
    crystallographic methods to solve with high quantitative accuracy the average
    position of atoms in the crystal, and from the early dates of ultra fast x-ray
    studies there have been crystallographic measurements that sought to follow atomic
    trajectories.   However, if your target material is not a crystal but a molecule
    or a cluster of atoms or a nanoparticle, crystallography is no longer a good starting
    point for analyzing your diffraction data.  The atomic pair distribution function
    (PDF) analysis of powder or single-crystal diffraction data is now highly developed
    for this purpose and has become widlely used in the chemical and materials science
    communities.  The PDF function directly measures the relative positions of atoms
    in real-space and so, in principle, is a great option for making molecular movies.  The
    measurements require wide ranges of diffraction/reciprocal space to measured with
    good precision using short-wavelength probe particles.  All of these aspects present
    challenges for first generation XFELs.  However, currently emerging are  XFELs
    that can provide good flux of hard x-rays (~30 keV energy for example) making
    in principle ufPDF a very real possibility.  The short wavelength of electrons
    also suggests that ultrafast electron diffraction could be a explored for PDF
    analysis too.  In this talk I will describe the PDF method and our intital attempts
    to measure and make corrections to data from LCLS to obtain quantitatively reliable
    PDFs on picosecond timescales.  The experiment is to study the response of electronic
    dimers (a form of charge density wave) in  a strongly correlated electron system,
    CuIr2S4.  Initial results are very promising, suggesting that ufPDF could emerge
    as a highly promising, fully quantitative method for studying small clusters and
    molecules, opening the door to molecular movies of non-crystals

  abstract: "The atomic pair distribution function method is growing in popularity\
    \ as an approach for studying local structure in nanomaterials, amorphous materials,\
    \ moleculare materials and liquids, as well as a growing interest in the study\
    \ of local symmetry breaking in bulk crystals.  It is a direct measure of the\
    \ local structure in the vicinity of an atom.  As such, it is a very interesting\
    \ representation of the structure in the context of time resolved measurements,\
    \ becuase if the local bonding state or coordination of an atom is changed through\
    \ photoexcitation, the PDF gives a direct measure of that change, and how the\
    \ change propagates out in time from the location where it occured.\nDespite this,\
    \ to date there has been very little work in measuring ultrafast PDFs (ufPDFs).\
    \  The reasons are technological rather than scientific.  First, the resolution\
    \ of the PDF in real space is directly determined by the measured range in momentum,\
    \ Q.  To get quantitatively reliable PDF high Qmax values of greater than 20 inv.\
    \ angstroms are required, and this requires good fluxes of short wavelength x-rays\
    \ (> 20 keV) to be used.  Second, it is required to measure this wide range of\
    \ reciprocal space quantitatively with low backgrounds and linear detector response.\
    \  These limitations are now being addressed with latest generation large area\
    \ 2D detectors and the developing of hard-x-ray free electron lasers.\nI will\
    \ describe the PDF and how it could, in principle, be used in an ultrafast time\
    \ resolved context.  I will then describe our recent attempt to obtain moderate\
    \ resolution, quantitatively reliable, PDFs in an ultrafast PDF experiment at\
    \ LCLS at SLAC.  The initial results are very promising, which opens the door\
    \ to much more extensive quantitative time resolved local structural studies."

  abstract: Nanoparticles and nanostructures are at the heart of next generation technological
    solutions in sustainable energy, effective new pharmaceuticals and environmental
    remediation.  A key to making progress is to be able to understand the nanoparticle
    structure, the arrangements of atoms in the nanoparticles and nanoscale structures.
    Also critical is understanding the distribution of the nanoparticles and how they
    change in time as devices run and reactions take place.  We use advanced x-ray,
    neutron and electron scattering methods to get at this problem.  I will talk about
    these methods and show some recent success-stories in the fields of sustainable
    energy, pharmaceuticals and cultural heritage preservation.  However, I will also
    discuss the fundamental limitations on our ability to extract information from
    the data and how we are now turning to machine learnging and articifical intelligence
    techniques to give more insights.
