  professional_summary: Small clusters of atoms in solution or in a nanomaterial are
    easy to measure using PDF methods, but it is very hard to find models to explain
    the PDFs.  This paper describes an approach where the goal was to search for structural
    motifs (small clusters of well-ordered atoms) from the PDF signal.  Working on
    the assumption that specific types of atoms of will prefer to form lower energy
    arrangements, and many of these arrangements are likely to be present in previously
    solved crystal structures, the goal becomes to choose cut-outs from candidate
    crystal structures, and then choose atoms to remove from the cut-out until we
    get a good agreement with a measured PDF from a small cluster.  The task is to
    find good starting models that can then later be used in full refinements, but
    taking inspiration for the starting models from motifs that nature has already
    shared with us rather than trying to build clusters randomly.  A challenge is
    that, even for clusters of quite small size, the number of possible sets of atoms
    to try removing, and therefore the number of structural refinements that need
    to be carried out, becomes enormous if a purely combinatorial approach is taken
    to removing the atoms and testing.  We therefore made use of interpretable machine
    learning approach.  Using a gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) model for picking
    sets of atoms to remove, we analyzed the results by computing SHAP (Shapley Additive
    exPlanation) values, which give information about how much contribution each feature
    in the feature vector is contributing to the cost and allows us to rapidly see
    which atoms are contributing most to the residual and are the strongest candidates
    for removal
  synopsis: The problem of finding atomic cluster models for PDFs with just a few
    peaks is addressed.  The approach taken is similar to the related paper that describes
    a machine learning (ML) approach called ML-Motex.  However, in the current case
    a non-ML approach is taken which turns out to be orders of magnitude faster than
    the ML approach showing that ML is not always the answer.

  synopsis: Ultrafast laser-pump x-ray-probe measurements are used to investigate
    the phenomenon of melting in polycrystalline gold films. It is shown that a region
    of the sample remains in a hot-pre-melted state before melting, presumably due
    to energy being deposited into the lattice system by phonon scattering at grain
    boundaries that happens more quickly than the melting itself.

  synopsis: PDFs from many metallic nanoparticle samples have poor fits to simple
    crystallographic models.  This paper shows that for a wide array of different
    metallic nanoparticles, greatly improved fits are possible by introducing non-space-filling
    decahedral models for the structure.

  synopsis: ZnS is an important quantum dot material that is used as a passivating
    layer on photoluminescent quantum dots of other materials such as CdSe and InP.
    In this paper, a novel synthesis method is described to obtain colloidal ZnS NPs
    using a thiolate urea library of co-reactants.  It gives exquisite control over
    the size and shape of the resulting nanoparticles. Here, atomic pair distribution
    function analysis of the resulting ZnS particles yielded the sample average structure,
    size and shape of the resulting nanoparticles.

    of JUAMI are in huge part due to the vision and hard work of the other US founders
    (Sossina Haile and Peter Green) and current organizers (Simon, Sossina, Sara Skrabalak
    and Tom Mallouk), the senior African partners [Winston Ireeta Tumps, MU, Revocatus
    Machunda, NMAIST, Teketel Yohannes (formerly at AAU, now at the Ethiopian Academy
    of Sciences), Francis Wanjala Nyongesa, UN], as well as countless people who have
    contributed time and energy to the schools both in the US and Africa. We are very
    grateful to the vision and the strong support from the US National Science Foundation
    over a sustained period with special thanks to Margaret-Anne Wampamba, Linda Sapochak,
    and the funding over the years (DMR2023698, DMR1756245, DMR1539724, DMR1069120),
    as well as additional financial support from Northwestern University, the International
    Center for Theoretical Physics and US Office of Naval Research Global, and logistical
    support from MRS, AMRS and African Academy of Science. We also thank the presenters
    who share their time and expertise so freely, and the students who engage so thoroughly
    and bring so much passion.

  professional_summary: This book presents introductory examples of solving scientific
    problems using PDF analysis.  It addresses a gap in the literature between high
    level reference works such as the "Underneath the Bragg Peaks" books and "getting
    started" tutorials that come along with PDF software programs.  The reader is
    taken step by step through scientific examples in the literature, including code
    examples, that they can use as templates for studies in their own research.

  professional_summary: 'An emerging technology for obtaining pure water from highly
    saline brines, and also for chemical extractions from similar feedstocks, is to
    use thermal solvent swing extraction (TSSE) methods.  These rely on liquids with
    a very special property: They exhibit the rare lower critical solution temperature
    (LCST) phenomenon.  Liquid mixtures with this phenomenon phase separate at high
    temperature but mix at lower temperature, the opposite of the canonical behavior
    of immiscible liquids which mix at high temperature due to the higher entropy
    of mixing. Hypotheses suggest that LCST behavior is driven by molecular clustering
    in the liquid mixture, but despite almost of 100 years since this mechanism was
    first hypothesized, there is no direct experimental support for it.  In this work
    we developed a double-differential PDF analysis technique on synchrotron x-ray
    data, combined with small angle scattering data, collected as a function of composition
    and temperature to convincingly show dumbbell like amine-water-amine structures
    that form into very stable reverse micelle structures.'
  synopsis: A double-differential PDF method is developed and used to verify and characterize
    molecular clustering in technologically important Upper Critical Solution Temperature
    materials for the first time

  synopsis: A very early observation that local structure can deviate from the average
    structure from a neutron PDF analysis in the model for the high Tc superconductors,
    Ca/SrCuO2.  This was also supported by a theoretical calculation where a total
    energy minimization of a supercell, calculated using empirical potentials, showed
    a lower energy for the symmetry broken state but only when the atoms were moved
    sufficiently far off the equilibrium position to initialize the calculation.

  professional_summary: pyDataRecognition is a prototype application that explores
    the potential of machine-readable literature. The user, e.g. a structure scientist
    has a powder diffraction pattern from a particular sample collected on their powder
    diffractometer.User uploads experimental powder diffraction pattern to the search
    application together with limited amount of relevant experimental information.
    The program then runs the search query during which the user data is prepared
    for comparison to database, i.e. data resampling. The user data is then compared
    to the database entries through a similarity measurement that executes a correlation
    analysis. As a result,the database entries are ranked according to their similarity
    score, the correlation coefficient.
  public_summary: pyDataRecognition is a prototype application that explores the potential
    of machine-readable literature. The program takes an experimental powder diffraction
    pattern as search query input. The user data will be compared to a database of
    powder patterns from papers published in the IUCr journals. Based on similarity
    measurement through correlation analysis, the references for the most relevant
    papers will be returned to the user, together with a plot of the user data with
    the database entries of the top five papers of the search query.Machine-readable
    literature holds a great potential as making literature readable to machines means
    that humans can benefit from the high output rates of machines, data-driven literature
    search being an example, where literature search queries are driven by data, such
    that the references returned will be highly relevant to the data.
  synopsis: A prototype application for finding published papers given a powder diffraction
    dataset is described. This is an example of what might be possible if structured
    datasets are saved with papers in the future.

  synopsis: the tilt disorder in La2-xBaxCuO4 is studied in detail at various doping
    levels of doping using neutron PDF.  The local symmetry is found to be different
    than the global symmetry.  Inelastic neutron scattering also shows them to be
    dynamic in nature.  These are presumed related to the charge distribution and
    so related to ODL discovered later.

  synopsis: The low-doped region of La2-xSrxCuO4 is much better explained as a linear
    combination of short-range ordered LTT-like tilts than by the average crystal
    structure, as observed from neutron PDF measurements.  These may be the remnants
    of doping induced stripes.

    evolved with Cr doping, moving the material through a metal-insulator transition.  The
    presence of the disordered dimer state could be correlated with poor electrical
    conductivity.

  synopsis: Thin sheets of the layered van Der Waals material, TaS2, laying on a substrate
    were scanned with a nanosized x-ray beam and very small strains in the material
    could be measured from small shifts in the position on the detector of Bragg peaks
    being tracked.  The strains were very small, resulting from bubbles of trapped
    gas under the material, but could nonetheless be clearly observed and measured
    as a function of position resulting in characteristic ``coffee-bean" images.

  abstract: "A genetic algorithm is proposed with real value\nvariables, spatially
    based crossover operator, a small mutation,\nlarge scale mutation, vector sum
    local search and geometric only\nbased objective function to generate candidate
    molecule\nconformations from atomic pair distance data. To better simulate\nexperimental
    data only information from the pair distance data is\nused as constraints. Ideal
    Bucky ball with 60 atoms is used as the\ntest case with both perfect pair distance
    data and Gaussian noise\nperturbed pair distance data. The GA generated result
    shows\nmolecules close to ideal Bucky balls but with some defects. A\ndescription
    of the spatially based crossover operator is provided\nalong with a local search
    based on vector summed error for each\natom."

  professional_summary: We introduce the open-source software package diffpy.mpdf
    for magnetic pair distribution function analysis.  Written in python and part
    of the DiffPy suite for diffraction and pair distribution function analysis, this
    package allows users to build magnetic structures, calculate one- and three-dimensional
    magnetic pair distribution function patterns, and perform fits to magnetic pair
    distribution function data.

  professional_summary: A key challenge in materials is understanding how they transition
    from one phase to another, the so-called reaction coordinate. In principle, the
    ability to measure time-resolved atomic pair distribution functions with sub-picosecond
    time resolution could solve this challenge as the PDF can show quantitatively
    how atoms move with respect to each other as a following a exciting stimulus.  A
    major challenge is to carry out these experiments in using the X-ray free electron
    lasers (XFELs) that can provide this time resolution in prinicple.  This experiment
    demonstrates that this is possible, opening the door to future such experiments
    on a wide range of materials. In this case, the destruction of an ordered charge
    density wave state at the metal-insulator transition of the quantum material,
    CuIr2S2, was studied.

  professional_summary: Structure solution from powder diffraction data is a challenging
    task and often fails.  It is necessary when single crystals are not available
    for a compound.  The current process involves taking high quality powder diffraction
    data, indexing it to obtain the unit cell and labelling the Bragg peaks with hkl
    values, then using direct methods or real-space methods to get atomic arrangements
    in the unit cell. In this work we explore using an ML model to do an end-to-end
    structure solution from powder data.  A convolutional variational autoencoder
    is used and given powder diffraction data and some compositional information.  It
    outputs a continuous electron density distribution in a distorted Euclidean space,
    which can then be inverse mapped back to a crystal structure.  It shows promise
    at discovering the unit cell and atomic positions directly from the input information
    without navigating the human intensive workflows of current methods.  It works
    on a wide range of inorganic compounds from the ICSD database, including oxides
    and chalcogenides, currently restricted to cubic and trigonal space-groups.
  synopsis: An AI/ML model for structure solution from powder diffraction data is
    presented.  It takes XRPD data to 3D electron density and then structures and
    is demonstrated for cubic and trigonal structures as a proof of concept

  synopsis: A procedure is demonstrated for obtaining the orientational distribution
    function (ODL) and real space pole figures from 3D PDF data from a textured sample.  Historically,
    it has not been possible to study using PDF samples with preferred orientation
    and crystalline texture.  This paper successfully demnonstrates how this can be
    done and describes some software, Fourigui, for doing it.

  synopsis: Computed tomography PDF is demonstrated for the first time and applied
    to study the distribution of palladium nanoparticles on a catalyst body (the form
    that supports catalytic nanoparticles in a catalysis stack).  It is possible to
    see how the particles change structure as oxidizing and reducing atmospheres are
    flowed over the sample and how this varies with position of the particle on the
    catalyst body.

  synopsis: computed tomography PDF (ctPDF) is applied to study wood from the keel
    the Mary Rose, a valuable cultural heritage artifact, The flagship of the Navy
    of King Henry VIII of England, which sank in 1542.  The study found and mapped
    the presence of polymers placed there to stabilize the wood by conservators but
    also found nanoparticle impurities that came from anerobic bacteria that lived
    in the wood in the sea-bed before it was raised.

    Its use is demonstrated with constant-wavelength\nneutron data measured at the

  public_summary: This paper reveals a new understanding of a key mechanism behind
    the thermoelectric property of materials. Thermoelectric devices convert waste
    heat to electricity, or can be used as very efficient fridges, and is an important
    front in sustainable energy goals.  To gain this understanding we developed a
    new tool for probing the local structure of a material that works like a camera
    where you can vary the shutter speed from slow to fast, only on times that are
    a million million times faster (10^12 x faster) than a normal camera. When a camera
    points at a scene that is moving, things in that scene that move a long way while
    the shutter is open blur out and gradually disappear from the image. By varying
    the shutter speed you can see them disappear and reappear. This allows you to
    know which parts of an image are stationary and which are moving.  It also gives
    information about their speed by which is related to the shutter speed where they
    appear/disappear.  The new technique uses neutrons as a probe of the material
    and we called it variable-shutter PDF (vsPDF). The new information allowed a theory
    to be developed by the team that gives novel insight into the atomic bonding in
    these thermoelectrics and the importance of a previously undetected directional
    dependence of atomic motions in the crystal lattice.

  professional_summary: A difficult problem in nanoscience is, given a measured atomic
    pair distribution function, what is the nano-scale structure that gave rise to
    it. In this work we demonstrate a generative deep learning model that can rapidly
    return a structure model given a simulated or measured PDF for structurally straightforward
    close packed structures.  The model is generative, so can find structures that
    are close to, but not part of, the database of structures used for training the
    model.
  synopsis: An approach is demonstrated that can predict the structure of a material
    from its PDF using a machine learning approach (a graph-based conditional autoencoder).  It
    is shown to work on simple close-packed clusters.

  professional_summary: Finding the structure of a material from a diffraction or
    PDF signal is still a slightly tedious job even when it is a known material and
    the structure resides in a database. The StructureMining app at the pdfitc.org
    ``PDF in the cloud" site serves this role for PDF data.  It finds all candidate
    structures in the database that satisfy a filter and then carries out a quick
    and dirty structure refinement to the uploaded dataset.  This paper describes
    an effort to accelerate this process by pre-training a machine-learning model
    to return matches from the database without doing the refinement step.  It was
    trained on a relatively limited array of oxide materials, but works well for materials
    in that class.
  synopsis: A machine learning model is trained for accelerating the StructureMining
    activity.  It works well for a limited number of oxide systems.

  professional_summary: This paper reports the discovery of a local fluctuating orbital-degeneracy
    lifted (ODL) precursor state above the orbital-selective Peierls transition in
    NaTiSi2O6 Mott insulator. Significance and Impact Orbital-selective transitions
    in quantum materials are intriguing, important, and not fully understood. The
    discovery of a local symmetry broken precursor above the transition in NaTiSi2O6,
    and its interpretation as a novel dual-orbital ODL state, yields new insights
    into orbital-selective phenomena, showing that the ODL precursors materialize
    deep in the Mott insulating regime where charge fluctuations are suppressed.\n
    Joint x-ray and neutron pair distribution function (PDF) analysis is applied to
    track the local atomic structure across the orbital-selective Peierls transition
    in NaTiSi2O6. Local symmetry breaking is observed up to 490 K, the highest temperature
    accessed in this study. Spin dimers disappear at the transition, but local weaker
    Ti-Ti pairing is seen that breaks the t2g orbital degeneracy even at high T. A
    novel dual-orbital local fluctuating ODL precursor state is needed to explain
    the behavior.

  synopsis: We have recently been investigating the behavior or quantum materials
    at high temperature.  Since interesting states emerge in these materials at low
    temperature, it may be puzzling why this is of value.  However, what we are finding
    is that precursors to local broken symmetries are often present in some ghostly
    and difficult to detect form in the local structure at high temperature and this
    gives critical insights into the behavior that emerges at low temperature.  In
    this study, published in Phys. Rev. Lett., we find this behavior in a transition-metal-silicate
    material called a pyroxene.  What is particularly novel is that the state, called
    and ODL or orbital degeneracy lifted, state involves multiple quantum orbitals
    to form and results in a large but stable object in the structure that looks a
    bit like a molecule.

  professional_summary: In situ experiments taking place in the x-ray beam at modern
    synchrotrons, for example, in situ synthesis, produce data at very high velocities.  It
    becomes very difficult to assess the results of the experiment in real time, and
    the scientist is left with terabytes of data on return to their institution.  In
    situ powder diffraction and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) data has the
    structure that it is a time-series of spectra that evolve continuously in time
    which is well suited to principal component analysis (PCA) and non negative matrix
    factorization (NMF).  Here we showed that NMR can work in this context and furthermore,
    produces components that match signals from real materials, and weights that resemble
    the time evolution of those chemical constituents in the real system. This was
    validated against synthetic data where we knew the exact answer, and also against
    real measured data that are subject to experimental aberrations.  The NMF was
    shown to perform well and can rapidly give a clear picture of what is going on
    in the experiment in a completely model-free way.  We demonstrated it operating
    in a streaming context, allowing experiments to be followed in real time, and
    also in batch mode to help speed up post-experiment analysis.
  synopsis: Non negative matrix factorization was tested against simulated and real
    PDF data from the discharge of a battery electrode.  It was shown that, although
    this is a purely mathematical data reduction process, it resulted in mathematical
    components that strongly resembled real physical components in the system, and
    weights that closely followed the time evolution of the real physical components.  Software
    was also presented that allowed nmf to take place even when data were streaming
    from an experiment as well as in batch mode from a finished experiment.

  summary_professional: Materials that can switch from crystals to glasses and back
    quickly and at relatively low temperatures, and which have large changes in optical
    properties when they do, are valuable for information storage and processing using
    light.  This paper reports discovery of novel new such materials based on metal-orgranic
    frameworks that have a glass transition temperature of just 200C and a large reflectivity
    contrast of just 0.48.  Metal-metal correlations are important in this mechanism
    as indicated by PDF analysis.

  synopsis: A novel sol-gel method is used to make barium titanate nanoparticles with
    high dopings of barium and tantalum that have high dielectric permittivity.  These
    are difficult to make by conventional methods but have potential applications.  Extensive
    x-ray PDF characterizations were carried out to verify structure. They are shown
    by PDF to be non-centrosymmetric and therefore potentiall ferroic. Their structural
    phase transition temperatures are increased by the doping.

  abstract: "Structured Abstract\nBACKGROUNDTo understand material properties and
    functionality at the most fundamental level, one must know the three-dimensional
    (3D) positions of atoms with high precision. For crystalline materials, x-ray
    crystallography has provided this information since the pioneering work of Max
    von Laue, William Henry Bragg, and William Lawrence Bragg around 100 years ago.
    But perfect crystals are rare in nature. Real materials often contain defects,
    surface reconstructions, nanoscale heterogeneities, and disorders, which strongly
    influence material properties and performance. Completely different approaches
    from crystallography are needed to determine the 3D atomic arrangement of crystal
    defects and noncrystalline systems. Although single-particle cryo–electron microscopy
    (cryo-EM) has been under rapid development for 3D structure determination of macromolecules
    with identical or similar conformations at near-atomic resolution, this method
    cannot be generally applied to the physical sciences for the following three reasons.
    First, most materials do not have identical copies and cannot be averaged to achieve
    atomic resolution. Second, a priori knowledge of the peptide sequence and stereochemistry
    in protein molecules greatly facilitates their 3D atomic structure determination,
    but this knowledge is not applicable to physical science samples. Third, unlike
    in biological specimens, the presence of diffraction and phase contrast in the
    transmission electron microscopy images of most materials poses a challenge for
    tomographic reconstruction.These difficulties have made the objective of solving
    the 3D atomic structure of crystal defects and noncrystalline systems a major
    challenge for structural characterization in the physical sciences.\nADVANCESMajor
    developments in aberration-corrected electron microscopes, advanced detectors,
    data acquisition methods, powerful 3D image reconstruction, and atom-tracing algorithms
    have placed one method—atomic electron tomography (AET)—on the cusp of this breakthrough.
    In recent years, AET has been used to image the 3D structure of grain boundaries
    and stacking faults and the 3D core structure of edge and screw dislocations at
    atomic resolution. This technique has also revealed the existence of atomic steps
    at 3D twin boundaries that are hidden in conventional 2D projections. Furthermore,
    the combination of AET and atom-tracing algorithms has enabled the determination
    of the coordinates of individual atoms and point defects in materials with a 3D
    precision of {\\textasciitilde}19 pm, allowing direct measurements of 3D atomic
    displacements and the full strain tensor. Finally, the single-particle reconstruction
    method developed in cryo-EM has been applied for 3D structure determination of
    small (≤2-nm) gold nanoparticles and heterogeneous platinum nanocrystals at atomic-scale
    resolution.\nOUTLOOKThe future research frontiers of AET involve increasing the
    sample complexity (including real materials with different atomic species and
    disordered systems), image contrast (determining the 3D atomic positions of both
    heavy and light elements), detection sensitivity (revealing individual atoms at
    surfaces and interfaces), and data acquisition speed (probing the dynamics of
    individual atoms and defects). The ability to precisely determine all atomic coordinates
    and species in real materials without assuming crystallinity will transform our
    understanding of structure-property relationships at the most fundamental level.
    For instance, using atomic coordinates as inputs to first-principles calculations,
    it is possible to compute the effect on the material properties of each defect
    and atomic reorganization, giving precious clues about how to modify and engineer
    materials at the atomic level to yield better performance in a device. Catalysis
    involves atoms interacting on nanoparticle surfaces in poorly understood ways,
    and the mechanisms of particle growth in synthesis reactors or in devices under
    load are largely unknown. Breakthroughs in our ability to reliably measure this
    information in 3D will have effects across disciplines from electronics and catalysis
    to energy conversion. {\\textless}img class=\"fragment-image\" src=\"https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/353/6306/aaf2157/F1.medium.gif\"\

    electron tomography (AET) and its transformative impact on the physical sciences.(Top)
    Schematic diagram of AET, in which 2D images are measured with an advanced electron
    microscope by tilting a sample to many different orientations. The 3D structure
    of the sample is iteratively reconstructed from the images, and the coordinates
    of individual atoms are localized. (Bottom) AET enables 3D imaging of crystal
    defects—such as grain boundaries, stacking faults, dislocations, and point defects—at
    atomic resolution. The ability to precisely determine the 3D coordinates of individual
    atoms allows direct measurements of atomic displacements and the full strain tensor
    in materials.\nCrystallography has been fundamental to the development of many
    fields of science over the last century. However, much of our modern science and
    technology relies on materials with defects and disorders, and their three-dimensional
    (3D) atomic structures are not accessible to crystallography. One method capable
    of addressing this major challenge is atomic electron tomography. By combining
    advanced electron microscopes and detectors with powerful data analysis and tomographic
    reconstruction algorithms, it is now possible to determine the 3D atomic structure
    of crystal defects such as grain boundaries, stacking faults, dislocations, and
    point defects, as well as to precisely localize the 3D coordinates of individual
    atoms in materials without assuming crystallinity. Here we review the recent advances
    and the interdisciplinary science enabled by this methodology. We also outline
    further research needed for atomic electron tomography to address long-standing
    unresolved problems in the physical sciences."

  synopsis: Sugar is ubiquitous in our food.  Although it is predominantly present
    in crystalline form, it can also be present in the amorphous form, for example
    in pharmaceuticals to make the pills taste better, in confections and freeze-dried
    foods where it is valued for its fine texture and ease of dissolution.  Sugar
    can be amorphized in different ways.  In this study, the structure, physical and
    chemical properties of sugar amorphized in different ways was studied.  Our total
    scattering PDF was able to show that local molecular-level ordering differences
    existed between Melt quenched, freeze dried, spray dried and spin melt-quenched
    sugare existed.  Together with other characterizations of the degree of crystallinity
    and water contents, a picture emerged where at a fundamental level, the nature
    of the resulting amorphous state depended sensitively on the amorphization method.

  synopsis: Sugar is ubiquitous in our food.  Although it is predominantly present
    in crystalline form, it can also be present in the amorphous form, for example
    in pharmaceuticals to make the pills taste better, in confections and freeze-dried
    foods where it is valued for its fine texture and ease of dissolution. A critical
    factor in its use is the need to avoid or control recrystallization.  In particular
    freeze-dried, spray dried and ball milled a-sugar will recrystallize at low temperatures
    whereas melt quenched sugar will not.  One possibility is the presence of decomposition
    products in the melt quenched material.  The presence of thermal decomposition
    products was confirmed by our PDF analysis, suggesting it should be taken seriously
    as a factor in the recrystallization behavior of sugar.

  summary_professional: Interpretable machine learning (ML) provides a generalizable
    approach for combining information from multiple heterogeneous spectra. Random
    forest models were trained on X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES), atomic
    pair distribution functions (PDFs), and both inputs combined, to extract local
    atomic environments of transition metal cations in oxides. Feature importance
    analysis revealed the most informative regions in both spectra and how the information
    is balanced between them. Our approach enables exploration of information content
    and can inform experimental design when choosing between different methods.
  synopsis: original paper demonstrating use of interpretable ML for combining heterogeneous
    input spectra, XANES and PDF

  synopsis: The first of two seminal papers that demonstrates that PDF works in practice.  In
    semiconductor alloys there are two local bonds, Ga-As and Se-As and these should
    be visibke in the local structure but not in the average structure and this as

  professional_summary: Ritanovir and Lopinavir are anti-viral drugs used originally
    against HIV-AIDS but more recently also showed efficacy against COVID-19.  They
    are often produced in the amorphous form but can also exist in various crystalline
    polymorphs.  This study showed that co-grinding R and L could result in the ritanovir
    recrystallizing in a metastable form where, when it was ground on its own, it
    returned in the stable polymorph, showing that co-grinding constituents could
    be a pathway to different polymorphs.  The Lopinavir was resistant to recrystallization.  Atomic
    pair distribution function analysis of synchrotron x-ray data was used to quantify
    the crystalline amorphous mixtures.
  synopsis: Ritanovir and lopinavir antivirals were ground and co-ground under different
    circumstances.  PDF helped to demonstrate and quantify the amount of amorphous
    and recrystallized phases of the drugs that were produced under the different
    conditions

    the unexpected appearance of an intermediate amorphous phase during the early
    stage of synthesis of ZrO2 nanocrystals. This allowed fundamental aspects of the

  abstract: 'The methods currently used to calculate atomic pair distribution functions
    (PDFs) from organic structural models do not distinguish between the intramolecular
    and intermolecular distances. Owing to the stiff bonding between atoms within
    a molecule, the PDF peaks arising from intramolecular atom{--}atom distances are
    much sharper than those of the intermolecular atom{--}atom distances. This work
    introduces a simple approach to calculate PDFs of molecular systems without building
    a supercell model by using two different isotropic displacement parameters to
    describe atomic motion: one parameter is used for the intramolecular, the other
    one for intermolecular atom{--}atom distances. Naphthalene, quinacridone and paracetamol
    were used as examples. Calculations were done with the {\it DiffPy-CMI} complex
    modelling infrastructure. The new modelling approach produced remarkably better
    fits to the experimental PDFs, confirming the higher accuracy of this method for
    organic materials.'

  professional_summary: Electron micrscopy is a powerful method for studying loca
    arrangements of atoms and atomic defects in materials and has had enormous scientific
    impact.  However, when materials are very disordered, the description of the local
    structure becomes more statistical in nature and useful descriptions of the structure
    are in the form of correlation functions that indicate probabilities of finding
    atoms in the vicinity of other atoms.  This is measured using methods such as
    atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. Here we combine PDF with scanning
    electron microscopy to study local structural correlations as a function of position,
    with a sub-ten nm spatial resolution, in a hot rolled bulk metallic glass.  Uing
    the approach we can identify variatsion in local chemistry and bonding, and identify
    regions where nanocrystals of a second phase are beginning to nucleate.  The approach
    is rapid and quantitative and we expect it to be useful in a wide array of contexts.
  synopsis: The scanning nansotructure electron microscopy (SNEM) method is demonstrated
    for the first time by looking at a bulk metallic glass that has been hot-rolled
    between polycrystalline nickel.

    oxide (Cu2O), run by an AI "creative co-pilot". Starting at the top and moving
    anti-clockwise, the "knobs" on the apparatus that control gas flow and temperature
    are set by computer control. The subsequent reaction takes place in the apparatus
    (left) that is mounted in an x-ray beam resulting in an x-ray absorption spectrum
    (lower left) that is measured in real-time. Software computes whether the changes
    in the spectrum (bottom) are producing a trajectory taking us towards the target
    (lower right). The AI agent uses this information to decide on new settings for
    the knobs on the apparatus that it thinks will take us closer to the target (top
    right), and sets them (top) and the cycle repeats. There is no human in the loop.

  professional_summary: The materials genome project is a major inter-agency initiative
    in the USA to use "genomic-like" informatic methods to accelerate the discovery,
    development and deployment of new materials in devices.  It gets its name from
    the highly successful "Human Genome Project" of the 1990's which had the goal
    of sequencing the human genome, but which enables the development of understanding
    of, and therapies for, diseases developed using informatic methods, despite the
    fact that materials do not have a genome.  In this paper we explore whether we
    can actually define a materials genome if we define a gene as a 1D code that codes
    for 3D atomic structure, much as DNA does for folded proteins.  We explore whether
    the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) can fulfill this role, and further,
    if we do use the PDF, and other mathematical invariants based on the PDF, what
    new discoveries and insights about materials might emerge.

  professional_summary: Increasingly, there is demand to use laboratory based diffractometers
    to collect x-ray diffraction data suitable for PDF analysis.  In this paper we
    explore different protocols for acquiring data, and explore whether it is necessary
    to carry out an absorption correction when using a Mo Lab source together with
    the PDFgetX3 data reduction protocols.  The lab-data derived PDFs were compared
    to those obtained from the same materials but using the commonly used synchrotron
    Rapid Acquisition PDF approach.
  synopsis: Protocols for data acquisition and analysis are compared on test samples
    of amorphous and crystalline silica. Optimal protocols are proposed.

  professional_summary: Structural modelling of octahedral tilts in perovskites is
    typically carried out using the symmetry constraints of the resulting space group.
    In most cases, this introduces more degrees of freedom than those strictly necessary
    to describe only the octahedral tilts. It can therefore be a challenge to disentangle
    the octahedral tilts from other structural distortions such as cation displacements
    and octahedral distortions. This paper reports the development of constraints
    for modelling pure octahedral tilts and implementation of the constraints in diffpy-CMI,
    a powerful package to analyse pair distribution function (PDF) data. The program
    allows features in the PDF that come from rigid tilts to be separated from non-rigid
    relaxations, providing an intuitive picture of the tilting. The model has many
    fewer refinable variables than the unconstrained space group fits and provides
    robust and stable refinements of the tilt components. It further demonstrates
    the use of the model on the canonical tilted perovskite CaTiO3 which has the known
    Glazer tilt system a+b-b-. The Glazer model fits comparably to the corresponding
    space-group model Pnma below r = 14 A and becomes progressively worse than the
    space-group model at higher r due to nonrigid distortions in the real material.
  synopsis: A model has been developed for refining rigid octahedral rotations in
    perovskites and demonstrated to model pair distribution function data of CaTiO3.

  professional_summary: Glassy phases of framework materials feature unique and tunable
    properties that are advantageous for gas separation membranes, solid electrolytes,
    and phase-change memory applications. However, the structural and chemical diversity
    of porous frameworks that can be liquified and quenched into a glass has been
    limited by thermal decomposition at—or below—the high temperatures required to
    induce a melting transition. Utilizing a desymmetrization strategy, we report
    a new guanidinium organosulfonate hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) that
    melts and vitrifies below 100 C. In this low-temperature regime, non-covalent
    interactions between guest molecules and the porous framework become a dominant
    contributor to the overall stability of the structure, resulting in unusual phase
    behavior such as guestdependent melting, glass, and recrystallization transitions.
    Through molecular dynamics simulations and pair distribution function analysis,
    we show that the local structure of the amorphous liquid and glass phase resembles
    that of the parent crystalline framework. Access to molten phases of framework
    materials at moderate temperatures should permit the use of more thermally sensitive
    functional groups and enhance the structural control and tunability that can be
    realized in network-forming glasses.
  synopsis: A novel guanidinium organosulfonate hydrogen-bonded organic framework
    (HOF) is reported that melts and vitrifies below 100 °C, a very low temperature
    for a network system.  The survival of the local structural arrangements was established
    using PDF and MD combined.

  synopsis: Desolvation, the removal of solvent molecules from a substrate, is of
    great importance in drug development and production, food processing, organic
    synthesis and beyond.  This paper shows how grinding the substrate in the presence
    of different polymers has a significant effect on the desolvation.  Through the
    use of PDF analysis and Raman scattering, the intricate role of specific solvent-polymer
    interactions is revealed.

  professional_summary: Non negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown previously
    to rapidly decompose large powder diffraction and atomic pair distribution function
    (PDF) datasets into their constituent structural signals. Despite the utility
    of NMF for quickly providing insight on large datasets, it is yet to gain widespread
    adoption in the diffraction community. This is arguably due to a lack of a graphical
    user interface or well written instructions to perform the analysis on diffraction
    data. nmfMapping is presented in this paper as a web application that provides
    an intuitive interface for exactly this purpose. This paper describes the interface
    in detail, and provides two real examples of how the application has been used
    to provide rapid insight into large in situ and operando datasets.
  public_summary: Advancements in engineering have led to widespread utilization of
    increasingly complex materials in devices that have become integral parts of our
    everyday lives. A few examples of this complexity include the dynamic rearrangement
    of atoms in various geometric patterns during use (i.e. batteries) and the use
    of materials that require precise control of atom configuration during manufacturing.
    In order to improve the devices that depend on these complex materials, we need
    to gain a better understanding of how the atomic configuration changes over time
    and space. Determining the average configuration of atoms throughout space and
    time is a difficult task, typically requiring that geometric models be developed
    and subsequently tracked over a large number of experimental signals. However,
    recent advancements in machine learning has lead to the development of tools that
    can track these kinds of signals over space and time without the need to develop
    or utilize a geometric model. This can rapidly provide unforeseen insight into
    how the atoms are rearranging from one measurement to the next. This work describes
    a new web application that makes utilization of this algorithm, known as NMF,
    intuitive for scientists that specialize in tracking average atomic arrangements.
  synopsis: A web application called nmfMapping was created and launched on the pdfitc.org
    website. This application provides a graphical interface for performing NMF decomposition
    of powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) and atomic pair distribution function (PDF)
    data. This paper describes the utility of this application through a description
    of the interface, along with two examples of how the app has been used to accelerate
    the analysis process.

  summary_professional: The optical float-zone furnace approach for growing large
    single crystals is a foundational practice in science as it is the best and sometimes
    only way to grow such crystals from complex materials. However, the practice is
    considered as something of a ``black art" where the outcomes are sensitively dependent
    on parameters used in the growth.  There is little fundamental understanding of
    the underlying physics and chemistry of the nucleation and growth processes.  Progress
    will be made if the positions, shapes and qualities of crystallites that form
    during the growth process could be tracked in a non-destructive way, such as in
    an in situ growth at an x-ray synchrotron.  For this to succeed it is necessary
    to have data analysis protocols and analysis tools that can do this mapping in
    a rapid fashion. This work demonstrated a proof of principle of such grain mapping
    from previously grown TiO2 boules, making use of advanced image processing tools
    for tracking and mapping the grains.
  synopsis: Spatial mapping of diffraction patterns from a boule that was grown in
    an optical float zone furnace was carried out and automated tools for tracking
    the grains were developed.  The regions that were good powders were separated
    from those that had a few crystals of a single crystal.  In the latter regions,
    image processing methods such as blob tracking were used to map the positions
    and crystal quality of crystallites in the beam.  The ultimate goal will be to
    carry out these measurements in an in situ crystal growth context.

  professional_summary: Typically, conventional structure transitions occur from a
    low symmetric state to a higher symmetry state upon warming. This paper reports
    the discovery of this "emphanitic" phenomenon in the diamondoid compound AgGaTe2.  The
    phenomenon has previously been seen only in Pb and Sn containing compounds where
    the lone-pair on the metal ion plays an important role.  Here there is no lone-pair.  DFT
    calculations indicates that it is a  weak sd3 orbital hybridization of the tetrahedral
    Ag atoms that leads to a  distortion of the crystal structure. It also results
    in a strong acoustic–optical phonon scattering which can explain the ultralow
    thermal conductivity in AgGaTe2 and its promising thermoelectric properties.

  professional_summary: The technologically important cubic paraelectric oxide perovskites
    ABO3, represented by BaTiO3, exemplify the widespread solid-state behavior of
    structural phase transitions to higher symmetry phases on warming. However, A
    long-standing question surrounds experimental observations, e.g., diffuse x-ray
    scattering, second harmonic generation, and piezoelectricity, which require a
    lower symmetry structure. This symmetry-breaking has been ascribed to thermal
    effects; however, here, we show from first principles theory that it is has an
    intrinsic origin.  It is a static, non- long-range-ordered distortion driven by  a
    lowering of the internal energy, which breaks its inversion-symmetry consistent
    with experimental observations. Finite temperature molecular dynamics show that
    these distortions remain at high temperatures, different from the general picture
    of cubic BTO about single parabolic energy surface without static displacements.
