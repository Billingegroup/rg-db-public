  background_fields:
    - No particular experience required but a keen interest in using, or learning
      to use, computers to analyze data to answer interesting scientific questions.
      Experience in coding in python is a plus as is any experience with data analysis,
      including AI, and machine learning.

    <p> We usually have open research opportunities in the group for excellent
    and motivated graduate students.  If this fits your description and you think
    you may want to join us we would love to hear from you</p> <ol> <li>If you are
    a Ph.D student at Columbia University in Materials Science, Applied Physics, Applied
    Mathematics or any department in SEAS,  then please contact Professor Billinge
    (sb2896@columbia.edu).</li> <li>If you are a Ph.D student at Columbia University
    in the Physics or Chemistry Departments, or in some related discipline,  then
    please contact Professor Billinge (sb2896@columbia.edu).</li> <li>If you would
    like to study for your Ph.D in the group but you are not already admitted into
    the PhD program at Columbia then you need to apply either for the Materials Science
    PhD program or the Applied Physics PhD program (http://www.apam.columbia.edu).  Ph.D
    students are generally admitted beginning in the fall semester and the deadline
    for applications is usually around December of the previous year.  Start the process
    early. You will need a valid GRE score, and TOEFL if you are applying from a non-english-speaking
    country.</li> </ol> <p>There are multiple opportunities in the group to learn
    how to understand atomic arrangements on the nanoscale (a billionth of a meter)
    and the relationship of these to properties of those materials.  In the group
    we study a wide range of materials, from the applied (HIV pharmaceuticals) to
    the pure science (understanding novel magnetic and superconducting properties
    of exotic quantum materials with no known applications).  We also develop new
    experimental and computational methods for analyzing nanostructure.</p><p>  Depending
    on your interests there are likely to be various options available to work on.
    What all the projects have in common is the use of computers to carry out advanced
    data analysis.  No prior experience is required for these positions, but for success
    it is necessary that you have an interest in learning how to use advanced computing,
    including for example, machine learning, AI and other statistical methods to answer
    real scientific questions.  Experience in these areas, and in programming in Python,
    is even better.</p>
