    impacts on our lives in general.  A question arises whether they will be useful
    tools to help us carry out our scientific research.  In this project, we explore
    this question and develop AI/ML methods for carrying out better and more innovative

  description: Complex liquids, and liquid-liquid interactions, are at the heart of
    separation technologies, thermo-responsive behavior, solubility and life itself.  Extracting
    structural information from liquids is a challenge due to the extensive averaging
    that takes place.  This project aims to apply latest generation local structural
    methods and modeling, including machine learning, to gain greater insights into
    the complex liquid, property, relationship

  description: Pretty much everything is a big thing made of small things.  This project
    explores fundamental properties that this structure imbues on a system.  Because
    of its ubiquity (that pretty  much everything has this structure) any properties
    that come from this general structure will need to be satisfied in a broad range
    of situations.  This project explores the fundamental nature of systems and extends
    the results to a broad range of situations.

local_symmetry_breaking:
  active: true
  description: 'Quantum materials are at the heart of emerging technologies from quantum
    computing to sustainable energy.  Using local-structural methods we have developed
    in the group, we have found that many quantum materials exhibit local symmetry
    breaking: the atomic arrangements at the local scale are different to those implied
    by the average crystal structure.  In many systems this response is intrinsic,
    though it can also be driven by extrinsic effects that can be controlled.  This
    project aims to characterize these difficult to measure phenomena and, further,
    to understand how the local symmetry breaking affects the material properties.'

        possible.  It was done using a novel approach of measuring a full 3D PDF using
        synchrotron x-radiation and using equations developed in the group in 2018
        to separate the signal into a structural part and an orientational part.

        us to develop a new theory for understanding the origin of the very low thermal

    atoms. I.e., the atomic structure. For around 100 years we have had x-ray based
    tools and algorithms that allow us to solve the structure of crystalline materials:
    crystallography.  Increasingly, we want to engineer materials at the nanoscale
    to give us different properties, but the nanostructure problem, the ability to
    solve the structure of nanomaterials, remains an unsolved problem in general.  This
    decadal project develops experiments, algorithms, and computational methods to

structure-of-excited-materials:
  active: true
  description: Knowledge of the structure of materials is behind our understanding
    of materials properties. However, the structures of materials that we solve normally
    are those of the material in its ground-state, i.e., its stable, relaxed state.  However,
    in real operating devices, materials are typically not in their ground-state.  In
    the device,  a force is applied to the material which is responding to that force.  To
    fully understand how materials are going to behave in devices, we therefore need
    to be able to study their structure out of the ground-state, in various excited
    states.  These could be states where the material is responding to a voltage or
    physical or chemical stress.  It can also be where the material is responding
    to a pulse of light from a laser
