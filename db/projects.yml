  description: 'Modern materials genomics aims to discover and bring to applications
    novel materials with improved properties on an accelerated time-scale using "genomic"
    methods based on data mining, materials informatics, and AI/ML.  It has been very
    successful at predicting previously undiscovered atomic arrangements ("materials")
    that are stable or nearly stable using computational methods.  But the ability
    to subsequently make those materials is a greater challenge.  This project aims
    to tackle not the materials prediction problem, but the materials synthesis problem:
    given a material, what is the recipe, or protocol, for making it.  We are interested
    in taking a data analytic view of this problem with a view to apply generative
    AI to the problem, but initially aim to find a simplifying framework for the problem
    by understanding the basic non-commutative algebra and topology of synthesis operations.'

local_symmetry_breaking:

  description: 'Quantum materials are at the heart of emerging technologies from quantum
    computing to sustainable energy.  Using local-structural methods we have developed
    in the group, we have found that many quantum materials exhibit local symmetry
    breaking: the atomic arrangements at the local scale are different to those implied
    by the average crystal structure.  In many systems this response is intrinsic,
    though it can also be driven by extrinsic effects that can be controlled.  This
    project aims to characterize these difficult to measure phenomena and, further,
    to understand how the local symmetry breaking affects the material properties.'

  description: This project will build a one-semester accelerated course in machine
    learning (ML) applied to STEM research problems for graduate and senior undergraduate
    level students in physical science and engineering.  Whilst data analytics, artificial
    intelligence (AI) and machine learning have revolutionized many aspects of life
    from commerce to politics and human interactivity, its impacts in  the physical
    sciences have been slower.  This is now rapidly changing,  with disruptive use
    of AI and ML to attack research problems that seemed unreachable just a few years
    ago.  There is a strong hunger among physical science and engineering students
    to attain new research skills enabled by ML and to apply them to problems in their
    domain.  The current training for this cohort of students includes extensive training
    in calculus, differential equations, a bit of linear algebra, rudimentary statistics
    and nothing in the way of ML.  The students often have an aptitude and some training
    in basic programming. Our goal with this project is to design a course that will
    build on the solid math skills of this group to accelerate their understanding
    and ability to adopt ML in their work. The course will build on this existing
    knowledge by combining a highly compressed introduction to ML taught by the Statistics
    department, but with a focus on newly developed hands-on projects (that we call
    Labs) where real (published) problems that apply different ML methods to materials
    science problems.  The Labs will be developed using the Google Colab platform
    and use the actual datasets from the published examples.  The developments will
    be made following strict standards for coding and documentation and maintained
    in a central GitHub repository.  As such, it will form a platform that will allow
    further Labs to be developed in the aread of Materials Science but also more broadly.  Indeed,
    this can turn into a widely used community resource that is under continuous development
    using standard open-source community development practices.
