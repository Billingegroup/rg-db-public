    group initiative.  The committee currently has a mission to increase inclusivity
    in the research group with a longer term goal of increasing the racial, ethnic

    on these issues to be had by the whole group every two weeks during group meeting,

      description: old description for safe-keeping...CODER is the Committee on 
        diversity and equity in research.  It is
        a student/early career researcher led activity with a mission of increasing diversity
        in the group by making the group more inclusive and supportive to people from
        many different backgrounds.  The group is organized by and for students and post-docs
        and has a platform at every second group meeting to raise discussions, lead activities
        or make other interventions that address issues of inclusivity and (non scientific)
        challenges being faced by members of the group.  The group is mentored by a senior
        person.  Any activity is proposed and developed by the CODER committee, then run
        by the mentor before being rolled out to the wider group.  The role of the mentor
        is to give feedback about any possible unintended outcomes that the group itself
        has overlooked and to make any suggestions that could make the activity achieve
        its desired goal.  This structure was arrived at through trial and error Issues
        that have been raised range from a discussion of sexism in physics, communication
        and good questioning skills, to burn-out and work-life balance.  Members of the
        group have expressed appreciation of having a forum to raise discussions and share
        experiences, including their successes and failures and the discussions in the
        CODER group-meeting segments are very rich, varied and often eye-opening.  The
        interactions between group members has definitely benefited and become more sympatico.  Permanent
        changes have been instituted as a result of this, for example, a "cultural holiday
        share" segment where different members of the group tell about about a holiday
        from their cutlture and how itis celebrated when it comes up.  The CODER group
        is completely student led and governed, but has a well defined mission and goals
        as well as mentorship.

  description: We recently identified that intrinsic orbital degeneracy lifting can
    result in broken symmetry states existing in d-electron materials at high temperatures.  The
    group of A. Zunger, Co-PI on this project, recently independently found that standard
    density functional theory quantum mechanical calculations can sometimes predict
    symmetry broken ground-states in materials where the most stable structure is
    lower in energy, and in symmetry, than the observed crystal structure.  This project
    is to try and gain insight into this novel phenomenon through a combined mathematics,
    AI, theory, and experimental campaign.

      description: Developed and validated the use of non-negative matrix factorization
        to automatically extract chemical components from \textit{in situ} chemical
        reactions taking place in an x-ray beam.  As a chemical reaction proceeds,
        reagents transform into products as a function of time, and in general form
        intermediate chemical species along the chemical reaction pathway.  By following
        this process in an x-ray beam, and automating the data analysis we can understand
        the reaction as it progresses. NMF  allows us to extract the physical components
        mathematically with no prior knowledge or models of the chemical species that
        appear and disappear during the process.

  description: This project will build a one-semester accelerated course in machine
    learning (ML) applied to STEM research problems for graduate and senior undergraduate
    level students in physical science and engineering.  Whilst data analytics, artificial
    intelligence (AI) and machine learning have revolutionized many aspects of life
    from commerce to politics and human interactivity, its impacts in  the physical
    sciences have been slower.  This is now rapidly changing,  with disruptive use
    of AI and ML to attack research problems that seemed unreachable just a few years
    ago.  There is a strong hunger among physical science and engineering students
    to attain new research skills enabled by ML and to apply them to problems in their
    domain.  The current training for this cohort of students includes extensive training
    in calculus, differential equations, a bit of linear algebra, rudimentary statistics
    and nothing in the way of ML.  The students often have an aptitude and some training
    in basic programming. Our goal with this project is to design a course that will
    build on the solid math skills of this group to accelerate their understanding
    and ability to adopt ML in their work. The course will build on this existing
    knowledge by combining a highly compressed introduction to ML taught by the Statistics
    department, but with a focus on newly developed hands-on projects (that we call
    Labs) where real (published) problems that apply different ML methods to materials
    science problems.  The Labs will be developed using the Google Colab platform
    and use the actual datasets from the published examples.  The developments will
    be made following strict standards for coding and documentation and maintained
    in a central GitHub repository.  As such, it will form a platform that will allow
    further Labs to be developed in the aread of Materials Science but also more broadly.  Indeed,
    this can turn into a widely used community resource that is under continuous development
    using standard open-source community development practices.
