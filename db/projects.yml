  description: 'Modern materials genomics aims to discover and bring to applications
    novel materials with improved properties on an accelerated time-scale using "genomic"
    methods based on data mining, materials informatics, and AI/ML.  It has been very
    successful at predicting previously undiscovered atomic arrangements ("materials")
    that are stable or nearly stable using computational methods.  But the ability
    to subsequently make those materials is a greater challenge.  This project aims
    to tackle not the materials prediction problem, but the materials synthesis problem:
    given a material, what is the recipe, or protocol, for making it.  We are interested
    in taking a data analytic view of this problem with a view to apply generative
    AI to the problem, but initially aim to find a simplifying framework for the problem
    by understanding the basic non-commutative algebra and topology of synthesis operations.'

  description: Complex liquids, and liquid-liquid interactions, are at the heart of
    separation technologies, thermo-responsive behavior, solubility and life itself.  Extracting
    structural information from liquids is a challenge due to the extensive averaging
    that takes place.  This is a new project to apply latest generation local structural
    methods and modeling, including machine learning, to gain greater insights into
    the complex liquid, property, relationship

local_symmetry_breaking:
  active: true
  description: 'Quantum materials are at the heart of emerging technologies from quantum
    computing to sustainable energy.  Using local-structural methods we have developed
    in the group, we have found that many quantum materials exhibit local symmetry
    breaking: the atomic arrangements at the local scale are different to those implied
    by the average crystal structure.  In many systems this response is intrinsic,
    though it can also be driven by extrinsic effects that can be controlled.  This
    project aims to characterize these difficult to measure phenomena and, further,
    to understand how the local symmetry breaking affects the material properties.'

        possible.  It was done using a novel approach of measuring a full 3D PDF using
        synchrotron x-radiation and using equations developed in the group in 2018
        to separate the signal into a structural part and an orientational part.

        us to develop a new theory for understanding the origin of the very low thermal
