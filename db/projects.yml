    'Modern materials genomics aims to discover novel materials and bring
    them into to applications on an accelerated time-scale using "genomic" methods
    based on data mining, materials informatics, and AI/ML.  It has been very successful
    at predicting previously undiscovered atomic arrangements ("materials") that are
    stable or nearly stable using computational methods.  But the ability to subsequently
    make those materials is a greater challenge.  This project aims to tackle not
    the materials prediction problem, but the materials synthesis problem: given a
    material, what is the recipe, or protocol, for making it.  We are interested in
    taking a data analytic view of this problem with a view to apply generative AI
    to the problem, but initially aim to find a simplifying framework for the problem
    by understanding the basic non-commutative algebra and topology of synthesis operations.'

    "Quantum materials are at the heart of emerging technologies from quantum

    in the group, we have found that many quantum materials exhibit local symmetry
    breaking: the atomic arrangements at the local scale are different to those implied
    by the average crystal structure.  In many systems this response is intrinsic,
    though it can also be driven by extrinsic effects that can be controlled.  This
    project aims to characterize these difficult to measure phenomena and, further,
    to understand how the local symmetry breaking affects the material properties."
