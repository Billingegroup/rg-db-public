    group initiative.  The committee currently has a mission to increase inclusivity
    in the research group with a longer term goal of increasing the racial, ethnic

    on these issues to be had by the whole group every two weeks during group meeting,

  description: We recently identified that intrinsic orbital degeneracy lifting can
    result in broken symmetry states existing in d-electron materials at high temperatures.  The
    group of A. Zunger, Co-PI on this project, recently independently found that standard
    density functional theory quantum mechanical calculations can sometimes predict
    symmetry broken ground-states in materials where the most stable structure is
    lower in energy, and in symmetry, than the observed crystal structure.  This project
    is to try and gain insight into this novel phenomenon through a combined mathematics,
    AI, theory, and experimental campaign.

      description: Developed and validated the use of non-negative matrix factorization
        to automatically extract chemical components from \textit{in situ} chemical
        reactions taking place in an x-ray beam.  As a chemical reaction proceeds,
        reagents transform into products as a function of time, and in general form
        intermediate chemical species along the chemical reaction pathway.  By following
        this process in an x-ray beam, and automating the data analysis we can understand
        the reaction as it progresses. NMF  allows us to extract the physical components
        mathematically with no prior knowledge or models of the chemical species that
        appear and disappear during the process.
