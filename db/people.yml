  bio: Sani grew up in Kassel, Germany. He earned his Bachelors degree in nanoscience
    in 2018 at the University of Hamburg. During his Bachelor project he worked on PDF analysis
    of electrochromic thin films in Prof. Dorota Koziej's group. Ever scince he
    continued working in her group as a research assistant, where he focuses on
    similar electrochromic systems and insitu imaging of nanostructures. He currently
    works in the group of Simon Billinge for an external Masters project. In his free time
    he loves watching soccer, going to the gym and playing the piano.
