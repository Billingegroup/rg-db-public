    - I give a brief bio about myself here. I have been carrying research in materials
      science since 1989 and been a faculty member in Physics and Applied Physics
      departments since 1994, though my training is in materials science.  I have
      been at Columbia since 2008 and have a joint appointment at Brookhaven National
      Laboratory. I have been working to develop the atomic pair distribution function
      (PDF) method for determining the local structure of bulk and nanomaterials for
      essentially my whole career.  We develop the experimental and data analysis
      methods and apply these methods to a broad range of materials from high temperature
      superconducting oxides to pharmaceutical drugs, in collaboration with chemists,
      geologists, materials scientists and physicists.  I have expertise in x-ray,
      neutron and electron diffraction and scattering, algorithm development for data
      analysis and modeling and software development, as well as a more superficial
      knowledge of the materials systems I have worked on such as metallic, oxide
      and chalcogenide materials and nanoparticles, small molecule organics, polymers
      and strongly correlated electron materials.
