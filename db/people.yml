      \ to the study of nanoscale structure and its role in the properties of diverse\
      \ materials of interest, for example, in energy, catalysis, environmental remediation\

      \ applying advanced computation and analysis, including artificial intelligence,\
      \ machine learning, and graph theoretic methods.  A major activity is the study\

      \ 3D arrangement of atoms from structures with nanoscale atomic structures from\
      \ scattering data, and the synthesis inverse problem, where the goal is to find\

    - I give a brief bio about myself here. I have been carrying research in materials
      science since 1989 and been a faculty member in Physics and Applied Physics
      departments since 1994, though my training is in materials science.  I have
      been at Columbia since 2008 and have a joint appointment at Brookhaven National
      Laboratory. I have been working to develop the atomic pair distribution function
      (PDF) method for determining the local structure of bulk and nanomaterials for
      essentially my whole career.  We develop the experimental and data analysis
      methods and apply these methods to a broad range of materials from high temperature
      superconducting oxides to pharmaceutical drugs, in collaboration with chemists,
      geologists, materials scientists and physicists.  I have expertise in x-ray,
      neutron and electron diffraction and scattering, algorithm development for data
      analysis and modeling and software development, as well as a more superficial
      knowledge of the materials systems I have worked on such as metallic, oxide
      and chalcogenide materials and nanoparticles, small molecule organics, polymers
      and strongly correlated electron materials.

        - The committee currently has a mission to increase inclusivity in the research
          group with a longer term goal of increasing the racial, ethnic and gender
          diversity of the group.  Committee members present a discussion segment
          on these issues to be had by the whole group every two weeks during group
          meeting, and also lead other social efforts in the group such as group movie
          nights and a stress-reducing intentional breathing segment during group
          meeting every week. It is formed and led by a set of volunteers from among
          group members with a shared interest in these issues with oversight from
          me.  Arguably, this is an inreach rather than outreach activity, but we
          feel that bringing meaningful change starts by addressing these issues internally
          first. As we make progress the plan is to reach outside the group to find
          similar activities in other research groups, departments and across the
          school, univesity and the academy.  The results of this activity have been
          eye opening, bringing to light the extent and ingrainedness of implicit
          biases while helping us to recognize them without feeling bad that they
          are there, and underscoring that the inreach before outreach approach is
          warranted.

        - These schools are NSF funded, take place in an East African location and
          bring together ~35 African PhD students and 25 US-based PhD students to
          learn research-grade materials science as well as to develop cross-cultural
          relationships and learn to work in teams to achieve research goals.  This
          was the third school in the series.  The first was in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
          in 2012, the second in Arusha, Tanzania, in 2016.  This one was in Kampala,

    in 2018 at the University of Hamburg. During his Bachelor project he worked on
    PDF analysis of electrochromic thin films in Prof. Dorota Koziej's group. Ever
    scince he continued working in her group as a research assistant, where he focuses
    on similar electrochromic systems and insitu imaging of nanostructures. He currently
    works in the group of Simon Billinge for an external Masters project. In his free
    time he loves watching soccer, going to the gym and playing the piano.

  bio: Yevgeny Rakita (Shlafstein) grew up in Israel and, after finishing his PhD,
    joined Simon Billinge's group. In the Billige group Yevgeny developes electron-beam
    based Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis techniques,   focusing on derivation
    and mapping of PDF-based quantities. In addition, he explores data harvesting
    during chemical synthesis using an approach known as MOSY - Movement Motivated
    Synthesis. The goal of his project is to harvest the entire history of a chemical
    reaction by parsing the components and sequences during synthesis of materials
    into a consequent set of actions that characterize a material with all of its
    physical properties. His aim is to create a “global-intuition” that is based on
    every experiment (successful and failed ones) relating to the process and property
    of materials.   His background is in chemistry and material-sciences, with a focus
    on energy-related   and biomedical materials, and he has an expertise in developing
    multidisciplinary frameworks for material fabrication and characterization. He
    completed his Ph.D. at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, where he studied the
    mechanical, structural, and opto-electronic properties of thin films and single
    crystals of photovoltaic materials. During his doctoral studies, he focused on
    halide perovskites and oxides that were self-fabricated using novel fabrication
    methods. Previously, he was involved in a research project on simulating soft-matter
    interactions (poly-electrolytes) in an ionic medium for energy-storage applications.
    He likes hiking, cooking and coding.
