  bio: Christopher grew up in Rockville Centre, New York. He attended Brown University
    where he earned a BS with honors in Chemical Physics. He worked with Prof. Shouheng
    Sun on electrochemical CO2 reduction and the structural dynamics of nanoparticles.
    After working at Brookhaven National Laboratory as a summer intern, he attended
    the University of South Carolina, working with Prof. Xiao-Dong Zhou on the atomic
    structure of solid oxide fuel cell components and earned a masters in Chemical
    Engineering. He joined the Billinge Group in 2016 and is currently working on
    analysis pipelines, data processing techniques and simulation software for PDF.
    Christopher is also a core developer for the conda-forge packaging ecosystem,
    president of Columbia qSTEM and sits on the Columbia Foundations for Research
    Computing advisory board. In his free time Christopher develops for open source
    projects, plays woodwind instruments, enjoys good scotch and works out by playing

  bios:
  - 'Prof. Billinge earned his Ph.D in Materials Science and Engineering from University
    of Pennsylvania in 1992, following a BA at Oxford University. He spent 2 years
    at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico as a post-doc before joining the
    faculty as an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at
    Michigan State University in 1994. He became Associate professor in 1999 and full
    professor in 2003. In 2008 he took up his current position as Professor of Applied
    Physics, Applied Mathematics and Materials Science at Columbia University and
    Physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

    His research focuses on the study of local-structure property relationships of
    disordered crystals and nanocrystals using advanced x-ray and neutron diffraction
    techniques. In particular he is a leader in the development of the atomic pair
    distribution function (PDF) method applied to complex materials. These methods
    are applied to the study of nanoscale structure and its role in the properties
    of diverse materials of interest, for example, in energy, catalysis, environmental
    remediation and pharmaceuticals. The approach is to use advanced x-ray, neutron
    and electron scattering methods, utilizing some of the world''s most powerful
    sources, and applying advanced computation and analysis, including artificial
    intelligence, machine learning, and graph theoretic methods.  A major activity
    is the study of the nanostructure inverse problem (NIP) where the goal is to obtain
    the 3D arrangement of atoms from structures with nanoscale atomic structures from
    scattering data, and the synthesis inverse problem, where the goal is to find
    an unknown synthesis recipe given a desired material product. These are non trivial
    ill-posed inverse problems that require novel applied math and computational approaches
    to solve.

    Prof. Billinge has published more than 300 papers in scholarly journals. He is
    a fellow of the American Physical Society and the Neutron Scattering Society of
    America, a former Fulbright and Sloan fellow and has earned a number of awards
    including being honored in 2011 for contributions to the nation as an immigrant
    by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the 2020 distinguished powder diffraction
    prize of the European Powder Diffraction Conference, the 2018 Warren award of
    the American Crystallographic Association, the 2010 J. D. Hanawalt Award of the
    International Center for Diffraction Data, the University Distinguished Faculty
    award at Michigan State, and the Thomas H. Osgood Undergraduate Teaching Award.
    He is Section Editor of Acta Crystalographica Section A: Advances and Foundations.
    He regularly chairs and participates in reviews of major facilities and federally
    funded programs.'
  - I give a brief bio about myself here. I have been carrying research in materials
    science since 1989 and been a faculty member in Physics and Applied Physics departments
    since 1994, though my training is in materials science.  I have been at Columbia
    since 2008 and have a joint appointment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. I have
    been working to develop the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) method for
    determining the local structure of bulk and nanomaterials for essentially my whole
    career.  We develop the experimental and data analysis methods and apply these
    methods to a broad range of materials from high temperature superconducting oxides
    to pharmaceutical drugs, in collaboration with chemists, geologists, materials
    scientists and physicists.  I have expertise in x-ray, neutron and electron diffraction
    and scattering, algorithm development for data analysis and modeling and software
    development, as well as a more superficial knowledge of the materials systems
    I have worked on such as metallic, oxide and chalcogenide materials and nanoparticles,
    small molecule organics, polymers and strongly correlated electron materials.

    other:
    - The committee currently has a mission to increase inclusivity in the research
      group with a longer term goal of increasing the racial, ethnic and gender diversity
      of the group.  Committee members present a discussion segment on these issues
      to be had by the whole group every two weeks during group meeting, and also
      lead other social efforts in the group such as group movie nights and a stress-reducing
      intentional breathing segment during group meeting every week. It is formed
      and led by a set of volunteers from among group members with a shared interest
      in these issues with oversight from me.  Arguably, this is an inreach rather
      than outreach activity, but we feel that bringing meaningful change starts by
      addressing these issues internally first. As we make progress the plan is to
      reach outside the group to find similar activities in other research groups,
      departments and across the school, univesity and the academy.  The results of
      this activity have been eye opening, bringing to light the extent and ingrainedness
      of implicit biases while helping us to recognize them without feeling bad that
      they are there, and underscoring that the inreach before outreach approach is
      warranted.

  bio: "Yevgeny Rakita (Shlafstein) grew up in Israel and, after finishing his PhD,\
    \ joined Simon Billinge's group. In the Billige group Yevgeny developes electron-beam\
    \ based Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis techniques,   focusing on derivation\
    \ and mapping of PDF-based quantities. In addition, he explores data harvesting\
    \ during chemical synthesis using an approach known as MOSY - Movement Motivated\
    \ Synthesis. The goal of his project is to harvest the entire history of a chemical\
    \ reaction by parsing the components and sequences during synthesis of materials\
    \ into a consequent set of actions that characterize a material with all of its\
    \ physical properties. His aim is to create a \u201Cglobal-intuition\u201D that\
    \ is based on every experiment (successful and failed ones) relating to the process\
    \ and property of materials.   His background is in chemistry and material-sciences,\
    \ with a focus on energy-related   and biomedical materials, and he has an expertise\
    \ in developing multidisciplinary frameworks for material fabrication and characterization.\
    \ He completed his Ph.D. at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, where he studied\
    \ the mechanical, structural, and opto-electronic properties of thin films and\
    \ single crystals of photovoltaic materials. During his doctoral studies, he focused\
    \ on halide perovskites and oxides that were self-fabricated using novel fabrication\
    \ methods. Previously, he was involved in a research project on simulating soft-matter\
    \ interactions (poly-electrolytes) in an ionic medium for energy-storage applications.\
    \ He likes hiking, cooking and coding."
