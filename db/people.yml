  bio: Christopher grew up in Rockville Centre, New York. He attended Brown University
    where he earned a BS with honors in Chemical Physics. He worked with Prof. Shouheng
    Sun on electrochemical CO2 reduction and the structural dynamics of nanoparticles.
    After working at Brookhaven National Laboratory as a summer intern, he attended
    the University of South Carolina, working with Prof. Xiao-Dong Zhou on the atomic
    structure of solid oxide fuel cell components and earned a masters in Chemical
    Engineering. He joined the Billinge Group in 2016 and is currently working on
    analysis pipelines, data processing techniques and simulation software for PDF.
    Christopher is also a core developer for the conda-forge packaging ecosystem,
    president of Columbia qSTEM and sits on the Columbia Foundations for Research
    Computing advisory board. In his free time Christopher develops for open source
    projects, plays woodwind instruments, enjoys good scotch and works out by playing
    squash.

    in 2018 at the University of Hamburg. During his Bachelor project he worked on
    PDF analysis of electrochromic thin films in Prof. Dorota Koziej's group. Ever
    scince he continued working in her group as a research assistant, where he focuses
    on similar electrochromic systems and insitu imaging of nanostructures. He currently
    works in the group of Simon Billinge for an external Masters project. In his free
    time he loves watching soccer, going to the gym and playing the piano.
